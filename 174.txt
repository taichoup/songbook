[Verse]

C                                                Am
I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told
          G
I have squandered my resistance
                     C
For a pocketful of mumbles such are promises
            Am            G                  F
All lies and jest still a man hears what he wants to hear
                   C      G    C
And disregards the rest

                                                    Am
When I left my home and family I was no more than a boy
        G
In the company of strangers
       Dm7        C
In the quiet of a railway station running scared
      Am           G                F                            C
Laying low seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go
        G              F    Em   Dm    C
Looking for the places only they would know

[Interlude]

       Am
Lie-la-lie
       G
Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie
       Am
Lie la lie
G                       F           G   C
Lie-la-lie la la la la lie la la la la lie

[Verse]

                                                Am
Asking only workmans wages I come looking for a job
               G
But I get no offers
        Dm7              C
Just a come-on from the whores on seventh avenue
       Am                 Dm7     G     F                                 C
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome I took some comfort there

[Interlude]

       G               C
Ooo-la-la la la la la

       Am
Lie-la-lie
       G
Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie
       Am
Lie la lie
G                       F           G   C
Lie-la-lie la la la la lie la la la la lie

[Verse]

C
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
G7  C              Am
And wishing I was gone
      G             Dm7      G7               G  C
Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
           Am
Leading me
       G
Going Home

      C                                            Am
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
         G
And he carries the reminders
   G7               C                        Dm7     G7        C
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down or cut him 'till he cried out
                       Am
In his anger and his shame
       G              F                              C       G C  G      F      C
"I am Leaving, I am Leaving."  But the Fighter still remains

[Interlude]

       Am
Lie-la-lie
       G
Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie
       Am
Lie la lie
G                        F             Am
Lie-la-lie la la la la lie la la la la lie
