[Verse 1]
Am                  F           G          Am
      black is the colour of my true loves hair
                    F           G      E7
       her lips are like some roses fair
                            F    G                E7
       she had the sweetest smile and the gentelest hands
                      F      G         Am
       and i love the ground whereon she stands
[Verse 2]
i love my love and well she knows
      i love the ground whereon she goes
      i wish the day it soon would come
      when she and i would be as one
[Verse 3]
i go to the clyde and i mourn and weep
      for satisfied i ne 'er can be
      i wrote her a letter just a few short lines 
      and suffer death a thousand times

[Repeat Verse 1]
