Queen Vickie used to sit upon her magic stane
Makin up governments all of her own
But they took that privilege away from the queen
And gave it to a lassie that they call Christine.
CHORUS:
With your Tooria, falderdoodle Da
Tooria Oriooria.
With your Tooria, falderdoodle Da
Tooria Oriooria.
Christine was poor when she left the school
But she made a lot of cash, she was nobody's fool
She didn't make it working on the factory floor
She went to London and became -- a model.
In London Christine did go well
With a house and a Rolls Royce all to herself
But the silly wee thing she fell in love
With Gordon-Edgecombe-Ivanov.
For she had another laud called John
He was always there when the rest had gone
He was sure he was the luckiest man alive
Till he fell into the arms of the M.I.5
M.I.5 were awful taken aback
They were nearly even gonna tell their Uncle Mac.
For here was a Tory and a rye buck Red
Fighting out the cold war in Christine's bed.
Lucky Gordon's back in the jail again
And Mac's getting thrown out at number ten
The Ministers are all in a terrible rage
And Christine's thinking of going on the stage.
