THE MIDNIGHT SPECIAL
Traditional; arranged by by John Fogerty
performed by Creedence Clearwater Revival
tab transcribed by Collins Crapo 


(initially, single, slow strums of each chord)

[Verse]
D                                G
Well, you wake up in the mornin'
                           D
You hear the work bell ring
                               A7
And they march you to the table
                         D
You see the same old thing
                           G
Ain't no food upon the table
                        D
And no fork up in the pan
                                 A7
But you'd better not complain, boy
                              D
You'll get in trouble with the man

(now speed up tempo and strum continuously; all subsequent verses have
  same pattern as chorus)


[CHORUS]
                G
Let the midnight special
                  D
Shine the light on me
                A7
Let the midnight special
                  D
Shine the light on me
                G
Let the midnight special
                  D
Shine the light on me
                A7
Let the midnight special
                     D
Shine the ever-lovin' light on me


[Verse 2]
D                     G
Yonder come Miss Rosie
                          D
How in the world did you know
                          A7
By the way she wears her apron
                     D
And the clothes she wore
                     G
Umbrella on her shoulder
                       D
Piece of paper in her hand
                        A7
She come to see the gov'nor
                    D
She wanna free her man


[CHORUS]
                G
Let the midnight special
                  D
Shine the light on me
                A7
Let the midnight special
                  D
Shine the light on me
                G
Let the midnight special
                  D
Shine the light on me
                A7
Let the midnight special
                     D
Shine the ever-lovin' light on me


[Verse 3]
D                     G
If you're ever in Houston
                       D
Ooh, you'd better do right
                   A7
You'd better not gamble
                       D
And you'd better not fight
                        G
Or the sheriff will grab ya
                           D
And the boys'll bring you down
                        A7
The next thing you know, boy
                     D
Ooh, you're prison-bound


(chorus twice; 2nd time, at last line, decelerate, with break at "light
on me," to final strum of D)
