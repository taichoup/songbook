TO DO

- disclaimer / license (I don't own any of the material)
- script to generate a kindle-compatible file ? with a TOC ?
    - for now I have a python script that kind of (sometimes) transforms my text files into html files with a title. THis can later by used by libs or calibre to generate an ebook
