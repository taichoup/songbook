Such a parcel of rogues in a nation

What force or guile could not subdue
Through many warlike ages
Is wrought now by cowards few
For hireling traitor's wages
The English steel we could disdain
Secure in valor's station
But we`re bought and we`re sold for English gold
Such a parcel of rogues in a nation

O would 'ere I had seen the day
That treason thus could sell us
My auld grey head had lain in clay
With Bruce and loyal Wallace
But pith and power to my last hour
I'll make this declaration
That we're bought and sold for English gold
Sic a parcel of rogues in a nation.
