Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here

Rhythm on a 12-string

[Intro]

Em7  G  Em7  G  Em7  A7sus4  Em7  A7sus4  G       x2

[Verse 1]

C                         D/F#
So, so you think you can tell,

            Am/E                   G
Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.

                    D/F#                      C                    Am
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil,

                     G
Do you think you can tell?


[Verse 2]

                     C                   D/F#
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts,

               Am/E                  G                             D/F#
Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change,

                 C                        Am                         G
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?


[Instrumental]

Em7  G  Em7  G  Em7  A7sus4  Em7  A7sus4  G


[Verse 3]

C                               D/F#
How I wish, how I wish you were here.

          Am/E                                    G                D/F#
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,

                                 C
Running over the same old ground. What have we found?

            Am                         G
The same old fears. Wish you were here!
