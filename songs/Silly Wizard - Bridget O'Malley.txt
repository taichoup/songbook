Silly Wizard - Bridget O’Malley


C         Em             F             Am
Bridget O’Malley, you've left my heart shaken
       F             Em          Am          F
With a hopeless desolation, I’ll have you to know
         F          Em             C              F
It’s the wonders of adoration your quiet face has taken
         F           Em            F    G C
And your beauty will haunt me, wherever I go.

C                        Em              F                    Am
The white moon above the pale sands, the pale stars above the thorn tree
    F              Em              Am         F
Are cold beside my darling, but no purer than she
   F            Em                C                  F
I gaze upon the cold moon tip the stars drown in the warm sea
        F                 Em          F     G  C
And the bright eyes of my darling are never on me.

C               Em        F            Am
My Sunday it is weary, my Sunday it is grey now
   F          Em             Am         F
My heart is a cold thing, my heart is a stone
    F           Em            C             F
All joy is dead within me, my life has gone away now
 F          Em       F        G   C
Another has taken my love for his own.

C             Em               F             Am
The day it is approaching when we were to be married
         F              Em       Am           F
But it’s rather I would die than live only to grieve
    F          Em              C                 F
Oh, meet me my darling ere the sun sets o’er the barley
         F        Em            F       G    C
And I’ll meet you there, on the road to Drumslieve.

C         Em             F             Am
Bridget O’Malley, you've left my heart shaken
       F           Em            Am          F
With a hopeless desolation, I’ll have you to know
     F              Em              C              F
it’s the wonders of adoration youre quiet face has taken
         F           Em           F     G  C
and your beauty will haunt me, wherever I  go.
