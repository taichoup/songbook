Woody Guthrie - Hobo's Lullaby

Woody Guthrie (Well, technically it's really by Goebel Reeves) to the tune of Just Before The Battle Mother by George F. Root 1862

(This is Arlo Guthrie and Pete Seeger's version. See below for Billy Bragg's version (easier to play arpeggio to))

Capo I *

G C  2x

G                     C
Go to sleep you weary hobo
D                          G   (G/F G/E G/D)
Let the towns drift slowly by
G                             C
Can't you hear the steel rail humming
D                    G
That's a hobo's lullaby

G                    C
Do not think about tomorrow
D                     G
Let tomorrow come and go
 G                           C
Tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar
D                          G
Safe from all the wind and snow

G                           C
I know the police cause you trouble
D                       G
They cause trouble everywhere
G                          C
But when you die and go to heaven
D                           G
You won't find no policemen there

G                                C
I know your clothes are torn and ragged
D                        G
And your hair is turning grey
G                           C
Lift your head and smile at trouble
D                          G
You'll find happiness some day

G                        C
So go to sleep you weary hobo
D                          G
Let the towns drift slowly by
G                             C
Don't you feel the steel rail humming
D                    G
That's a hobo's lullaby
