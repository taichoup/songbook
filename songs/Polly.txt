[Verse]

Em-G           D          C
Polly wants a cracker 
Em-G              D          C

Think I should get off of her first 
Em-G                  D     C

I think she wants some water 
Em-G          D    C

To put out the blow torch 


[Chorus]

D C         G
It isn't me 
Bb              D

We have some seed 
C          G

Let me clip 
  Bb           D

Your dirty wings 
D  C              G

Let me take a ride 
    Bb            D

Don't hurt yourself 
C               G

I want some help 
Bb             D

To please myself 
D   C             G

I've got some rope 
  Bb             D

You have been told 
C            G

I promise you 
Bb             D

I have been true 
D  C              G

Let me take a ride 
    Bb            D

Don't hurt yourself 
C               G

I want some help 
 Bb            D

To please myself 

[Verse]

Em-G         D       C
Polly wants a cracker 
Em   G              D     C

Maybe she would like more food
Em G                D   C

She asks me to untie her 
Em-G            D        C

A chase would be nice for a few 
Em-G       D        C

Polly says her back hurts 
   Em   G        D        C

And she's just as bored as me 
Em  G        D       C

She caught me off my guard 
Em G         D       C

It amazes me, the will of instinct

[Chorus]

D C         G
It isn't me 
Bb              D

We have some seed 
C          G

Let me clip 
  Bb           D

Your dirty wings 
D  C              G

Let me take a ride 
    Bb            D

Don't hurt yourself 
C               G

I want some help 
Bb             D

To please myself 
D   C             G

I've got some rope 
  Bb             D

You have been told 
C            G

I promise you 
Bb             D

I have been true 
D  C              G

Let me take a ride 
    Bb            D

Don't hurt yourself 
C               G

I want some help 
 Bb            D

To please myself
