[Verse]
 
C        E7                A           A7
I Once Lived The Life Of A Millionaire
Dm           A7            Dm
Spent All My Money, Didn't Have Any Cares
F           F#dim7            C           A7
Took All My Friends Out For A Mighty Good Time
D7                        G7
We Bought Bootleg Liquor, Champagne and Wine
C        E7     A       A7
Than I Began To Fall So Low
Dm          A7                Dm
Lost All My Good Friends, Had Nowhere To Go
F           F#dim7     C      A7
If I Get My Hands On A Dollar Again
D7                        G7
I'll Hang On It Till That Old Eagle Grins Because...
 
[Chorus]
 
C E7     A       A7
Nobody Knows You
Dm          A7       Dm
When You're Down And Out
F       F#dim7  C       A7
In Your Pocket, Not One Penny
D7                            G7
And As For Friends, Well, You Ain't Got Any
C            E7           A          A7
When You Get Back On Your Feet Again
Dm        A7               Dm
Everybody Wants To Be Your Long Lost Friend
F         F#dim7      C        A7
I Said It Strange Without Any Doubt
D7                           G7
Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out
