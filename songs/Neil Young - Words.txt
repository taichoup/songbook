Neil Young - Words

[Intro]

 Am F G Em x4



 Am                       F

 Someone and someone were down by the pond

 G                        Am

 Lookin' for somethin' to plant in the lawn.

 Am                          F

 Out in the fields they were turnin' the soil

     G                        Am

 I'm sittin' here hopin' this water will boil

        Am                          F

 When I look through the window and out on the road

         G                        Am

 They're bringin' me presents and saying hello.

         Am    F       G                  Am

 Singing Words words between the lines of age.

 Am    F       G                  Am

 Words words between the lines of age.



 Am F G Em  x14





 If I was a junkman sellin' you cars,

 Washin' your windows and shinin' your stars,

 Thinkin' your mind was my own in a dream

 What would you wonder and how would it seem?

 Livin' in castles a bit at a time

 The King started laughin' and talkin' in rhyme.

 Singing Words, Words between the lines of age



 Am F G Em         x8 (to fade)
