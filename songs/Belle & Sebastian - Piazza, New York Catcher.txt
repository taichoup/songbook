Belle & Sebastian - Piazza, New York Catcher

Capo II for recorded key.

E                                     A              E
Elope with me Miss Private and we'll sail around the world
F#m                            C#m
I will be your Ferdinand and you my wayward girl
    F#m                          B
How many nights of talking in hotel rooms can you take?
    F#m                             B
How many nights of limping round on pagan holidays?
     A                               C#m
Oh elope with me in private and we'll set something ablaze
  F#m            B         C#m
A trail for the devil to erase

E                               A                    E
San Francisco's calling us, the Giants and Mets will play
F#m                                C#m
Piazza, New York catcher, are you straight or are you gay?
  F#m                            B
We hung about the stadium, we've got no place to stay
  F#m                            B
We hung about the tenderloin and tenderly you tell
         A                              C#m
About the saddest book you ever read, it always makes you cry
   F#m              B               C#m
The statue's crying too and well he may

 E                                A            E
I love you I've a drowning grip on your adoring face
 F#m                      C#m
I love you my responsibility has found a place 
 F#m                                  B
Beside you and strong warnings in the guise of gentle words
    F#m                          B
Come wave upon me from the wider family net absurd
            A                                C#m
'You'll take care of her, I know it, you will do a better job'
F#m         B              C#m
Maybe, but not what she deserves

 E                                  A               E
Elope with me Miss Private and we'll drink ourselves awake
     F#m                            C#m
We'll taste the coffee houses and award certificates
 F#m                             B
A privy seal to keep the feel of 1960 style
     F#m                             B
We'll comment on the decor and we'll help the passer by
      A                               C#m
And at dusk when work is over we'll continue the debate
    F#m               B             C#m
In a borrowed bedroom virginal and spare

   E                         A             E
The catcher hits for .318 and catches every day
   F#m                              C#m
The pitcher puts religion first and rests on holidays
  F#m                            B
He goes into cathedrals and lies prostrate on the floor
  F#m                                     B
He knows the drink affects his speed he's praying for 
F# doorway 
      A                                C#m
Back into the life he wants and the confession of the bench
F#m               B            C#m
Life outside the diamond is a wrench

 E                                  A             E
I wish that you were here with me to pass the dull weekend
 F#m                                C#m
I know it wouldn't come to love, my heroine pretend
 F#m                              B
A lady stepping from the songs we love until this day
     F#m                          B
You'd settle for an epitaph like 'Walk Away, Renee'
         A                               C#m
The sun upon the roof in winter will draw you out like 
F# flower

F#m              B            C#m
Meet you at the statue in an hour
F#m              B            C#m
Meet you at the statue in an hour
