Pink Floyd - Jugband Blues

    C                             Am
It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here,
         C                       Am                           C
And I'm almost obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here.
     Am                        C
And I never knew the moon could be so big.
     Am                        C
And I never knew the moon could be so blue.
       Am                                  C
And I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes
   F                 G                A
And brought me here instead dressed in red.
       Bm        F#m          Bm           F#
And I'm wondering who could be writing this song.
G       D           A             D
I don't care if the sun don't shine.
   G       D       A          D
And I don't care if nothing is mine.
   F                   Am
And I don't care if I'm nervous with you.
F                        A
I'll do my loving in the Winter.

G  D  A  D  G  D  A  D ...  Am  C/G


       Am  C/G       Am
And the sea____ isn't green.
  C/G         Am
And I love the queen.
          C/G        A
And what exactly is a dream?
          C/G        A
And what exactly is a joke?
