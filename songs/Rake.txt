Townes van Zandt - Rake

     Dm
Well, I used to wake
   F
and run with the moon
 G
I lived like a rake and a young man
 Dm
I covered my lovers
    F
with flowers and wounds
  G                          Dm
my laughter the devil would frighten.

   F              G
The sun, she would come
   F            Dm
and beat me back down
   C                       Dm
but every cruel day had its nightfall
   F           G
I'd welcome the stars
    F            Dm
with wine and guitars
C                      Dm
   full of fire and forgetful


Dm
My body was sharp
F
the dark air clean
   G                 Dm
and outrage my joyful companion
   Dm
whisperin' women
   F
how sweet did they seem
G                     Dm
kneelin' for me to command them


F                 G
And time was like water
   F         Dm
but I was the sea
 C                        Dm
I wouldn't have noticed it passing
      F          G
except for the turnin'
  F          Dm
of night into day
   C                   Dm
and turnin' of day into cursin'


Dm
You look at me now
   F                   Dm
and don't think I don't know
    C                      Dm
what all of your eyes are a sayin'
       Dm
Does he want us to believe
F
these ravings and lies
G                                           Dm
they're just tricks that his brain's been a playin'?


F            G
A lover of women
F               Dm
he can't hardly stand
  C                           Dm
he trembles he's bent and he's broken
    F           G
I've fallen it's true
F              Dm
but I say unto you
C                                  Dm
hold your tongues until after I've spoken


Dm
I was takin' by pride
F
in the pleasures I'd known
 G                          Dm
I laughed and said I'd be forgiven
      Dm
but my laughter turned 'round
F                Dm
eyes blazin' and said
G                          Dm
my friend, we're holding a wedding


F           G
I buried my face
F                 Dm
but it spoke once again
C                       Dm
night to the day we're a bindin'
   F            Dm
and now the dark air
       F          Dm
is like fire on my skin
C                         Dm
and even the moonlight is blinding
