Johnny Cash - Ring Of Fire

[INTRO]

G    C  G  G  D G

[Verse]

G         C       G
Love Is A Burning Thing
              D     G
And It Makes A Fiery Ring
        C    G
Bound By Wild Desire
             D       G
I Fell Into A Ring Of Fire

[Chorus]

D             C               G
I Fell Into A Burning Ring Of Fire
      D
I Went Down, Down, Down
       C           G
And The Flames Went Higher
And It Burns, Burns, Burns
   C       G
The Ring Of Fire
   C      G
The Ring Of Fire
G    C  G  G  D G
G    C  G  G  D G

[Chorus]

D             C               G
I Fell Into A Burning Ring Of Fire
      D
I Went Down, Down, Down
       C           G
And The Flames Went Higher
And It Burns, Burns, Burns
   C       G
The Ring Of Fire
   C       G
The Ring Of Fire

[Verse]

C       G
The Taste Of Love Is Sweet
                D    G
When Hearts Like Ours Meet
              C      G
I Fell For You Like A Child
            D         G   
Ohh, But The Fire Went Wild

[Chorus]

D             C               G
I Fell Into A Burning Ring Of Fire
      D
I Went Down, Down, Down
       C           G
And The Flames Went Higher
And It Burns, Burns, Burns
   C       G
The Ring Of Fire
   C       G
The Ring Of Fire

[Chorus]

D             C               G
I Fell Into A Burning Ring Of Fire
      D
I Went Down, Down, Down
       C           G
And The Flames Went Higher
And It Burns, Burns, Burns
   C       G
The Ring Of Fire
   C       G
The Ring Of Fire
And It Burns, Burns, Burns
   C       G
The Ring Of Fire
   C       G
The Ring Of Fire (repeat until fade)
