Grateful Dead - Monkey And The Engineer 

(in the style of Dave Rawlings Machine)

G                             C      G

Once upon a time there was an engineer, 

G                           A7      D7

who drove a locomotive both far and near, 

G                                 C

Accompanied by a monkey who would sit on a stool,

G               A7         D7           G

watching everything the engineer would pull.



G                             C       G

One day the engineer wanted a bite to eat,

G                                  A7       D7

He left the monkey sitting in the driver's seat,

G                                       C

The monkey pulled the throttle the locomotive jumped the gun,

       G           A7            D7        G

and at 90 miles an hour down the main line run.





[Chorus]



G                     C        G

The big locomotive is right on time,

G                         A7       D7

the big locomotive coming down the line,

G                         C

The big locomotive number 99,

G          A7            D7      G

left the engineer with a worried mind.





[Verse 2]



G                               C      G

The engineer got the dispatcher on the phone,

G                             A7         D7

he told him all about his locomotive was gone,

G                                  C

he said get on the wire switch operator to right,

           G               A7        D7      G

cause' the monkeys got the main line sewn up tight.



G                           C          G

The switch operator got the message in time,

G                                        A7        D7

Said there's a north bound living on the same main line,

G                           C

Open up the switch we gonna let him on through,

          G                A7         D7    G

cause the monkey's got the locomotive under control.





[Chorus]



G                     C        G

The big locomotive is right on time,

G                         A7       D7

the big locomotive coming down the line,

G                         C

The big locomotive number 99,

G          A7            D7      G

left the engineer with a worried mind.





It is the same progression throughout the song.

Improvise and have fun with solos, repeats, etc.

A great and simple fun campfire song.
