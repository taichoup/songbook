D  A  4x
D       A         G            D
Did I see you down in a young girl's town,
                           A
with your mother in so much pain?
     G      A            Bm         E
I was almost there at the top of the stairs,
        D                A    D
with her screamin' in the rain
D        A     G        D
Did she wake you up to tell you that,
                       A
it was only a change of plan?
G               A          Bm        E
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup,
        D            A    D
with the promise of a man.
D       A       G        D
Did I see you walking with the boys,
                         A
though it was not hand in hand?
       G          A         Bm     E
And was some black face in a lonely place,
    D              A      D
when you could understand?
D        A     G        D
Did she wake you up to tell you that,
                       A
it was only a change of plan?
G               A          Bm        E
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup,
        D            A     D
with the promise of a man.
D       A              G     D
Will I see you give more than I can take?
                   A
Will I only harvest some?
      G        A            Bm       E
As the days fly past will we lose our grasp,
  D              A     D
or fuse it in the sun?
D        A     G        D
Did she wake you up to tell you that,
                       A
it was only a change of plan?
G               A          Bm        E
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup,
D            A     D
with the promise of a man.
G               A          Bm        E
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup,
        D            A     D
with the promise of a man.
