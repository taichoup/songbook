Traditional - Joe Hill

Joe Hill was a union organizer and songwriter. In 1914 he was accused of murder, and the following year he was executed, even though many people believed he was innocent. His songs are still an inspiration for all kinds of workers. For example, you might know “The Preacher and the Slave,” also known as “Pie in the Sky.”
You will eat, by and by
In that glorious land above the sky
Work and pray, live on hay
You’ll get pie in the sky when you die.
More famous than Joe Hill’s own songs, though, is a song that was written about him. Ten years after he died, Alfred Hayes wrote a poem called “I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night.” Earl Robinson set it to music about a decade later, and it quickly became an anthem for the labor movement.
Starting in the 1930s, the African-American actor and singer Paul Robeson was one of this country’s most passionate voices for the outsider. He lent his voice to the struggles of blacks, workers, and anyone who had trouble getting a fair deal. Paul Robeson sang “I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night” all over the world, at rallies and protests -- and in concert.

NB: the most famous version is Joan Baez at Woodstock, though :)
