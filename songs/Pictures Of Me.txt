Elliott Smith - Pictures Of Me

Start stop and start 
Stupid acting smart 
Flirting with the flicks 
You say it's just for kicks 
You'll be the victim of your own dirty tricks 
You got yourself to tease and displease 


Doors swinging wide 
You walked in to hide 
Looking at your feet 
Failure's complete 
Saw you and me on the coin-op tv 
Frozen in fear every time we appear 


I'm not surprised and really, why should I be? 
See nothing wrong 
See nothing wrong 
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me 
Completely wrong 
Totally wrong 


Go walking by 
Here come another guy 
Jailer who sells personal hells 
Who'd like to see me down on my fucking knees 
Everybody's dying just to get the disease 


Hey hey hey hey 
I'm not surprised and really, why should I be? 
See nothing wrong 
See nothing wrong 
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me 
Completely wrong 
Totally wrong 
I'm not surprised and really, why should I be? 
See nothing wrong 
See nothing wrong 
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me 
Oh everybody's dying just to get the disease 
Everybody's dying just to get the disease 
Everybody's dying just to get the disease
