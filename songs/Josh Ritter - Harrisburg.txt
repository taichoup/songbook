Josh Ritter - Harrisburg
Sometimes played capo III in concert

[Verse 1]
  Am                       F           C/G
Romero got married on the fifth of July
       C/G                G
In our Lady of Immaculate Dawn
  Am                             F           C/G
Could have got married in the revival man's tent
          C/G        G             Am
But there ain't no reviving what's gone
 
[Verse 2]
  Am                            F        C/G
Slipped like a shadow from the family he made
     C/G                       G
In a little white house by the woods
            Am                           F           C/G
Dropped the kids at the mission, with a rose for the virgin
       C/G      G        Am
She knew he was gone for good
 
[Chorus]
       C/G
It's a long way to Heaven
     G
It's closer to Harrisburg
     F                               C/G               G
And that's still a long way from the place where we are
       Am                F              C/G
And if evil exists its a pair of train tracks
        C/G        G        Am
And the devil is a railroad car
 
[Verse 3]
   Am                                  F                 C/G
He could have stayed somewhere but the train tracks kept going
       C/G                         G
And it seems like they always left soon
        Am                           F              C/G
And the wolves that he ran with they moaned low and painful
     C/G      G           Am
Sang sad misereres to the moon
 
[Chorus]
       C/G
It's a long way to Heaven
     G
It's closer to Harrisburg
     F                               C/G               G
And that's still a long way from the place where we are
       Am                F              C/G
And if evil exists its a pair of train tracks
        C/G        G        Am
And the devil is a railroad car
 
[Instrumental]
Am  F  C/G
C/G    G
Am  F  C/G
C/G    G   Am
 
[Verse 4]
  Am              F            C/G
Rose at the altar withered and wilted
   C/G              G
Romero sank into a dream
    Am                        F           C/G
He didn't make Heaven and he didn't make Harrisburg
   C/G       G           Am
He died in a hole in between
 
[Verse 5]
  Am                     F           C/G
Some say that man is the root of all evil
   C/G                          G
Others say God's a drunkard for pain
 Am                   F         C/G
Me I believe that the Garden of Eden
     C/G           G          Am
Was burned to make way for a train 
 
[Chorus]
       C/G
It's a long way to Heaven
     G
It's closer to Harrisburg
     F                               C/G               G
And that's still a long way from the place where we are
       Am                F              C/G
And if evil exists its a pair of train tracks
        C/G        G        Am
And the devil is a railroad car
