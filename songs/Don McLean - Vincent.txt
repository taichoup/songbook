Don McLean - Vincent.txt

[Verse 1]
               G
Starry, starry night
                   Am
Paint your pallet blue and grey
              C                 D7                               G
Look out on a summer's day with eyes that know the darkness in my soul
                                             Am
Shadows on the hills, sketch the trees and the daffodils
                         C                 D7                         G - C - G
Catch the breeze and the winter chills, in colours on the snowy linen land
 
[Chorus]
              Am     D7                   G        Em
And now I understand    what you tried to say to me
                         Am7     D7                           Em
How you suffered for your sanity     How you tried to set them free
                                A7          Am7 - D7           G
They would not listen, they did not know how   perhaps they listen now
 
[Verse 2]
               G
Starry, starry night
                Am
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
                  C            D7                                G
Swirling clouds in violet haze reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
                                      Am
Colors changing hue, morning fields of amber grain
               C                   D7                                  G - C - G
Weathered faces lined in pain, are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
 
[Extended Chorus]
G                 Am7      D7                        G  -  Em
For they could not love you,  but still your love was true
            Am7                            Cm6
And when no hope was left in sight on that starry, starry night
    G                F7           E7         Am7
You took your life as lovers often do,  But I could have told you Vincent
     C                                D7           G
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you
 
[Verse 3]
               G
Starry, starry night
                  Am
Portraits hung in empty halls
                   C                     D7                                  G
Frameless heads on nameless walls, with eyes that watch the world and can't forget
                                                     Am
Like the strangers that you've met, the ragged men in ragged clothes
                      C                D7                               G - C - G
The silver thorn, the bloody rose, lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow
 
[Final Chorus]
                  Am     D7                  G          Em
And now I think I know      what you tried to say to me
                         Am7     D7                           Em
How you suffered for your sanity    How you tried to set them free
                                   A7               Am7   D7               G
They would not listen, they're not  listening still     perhaps they never will
 
[Optional Outro]
