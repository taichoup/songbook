Capo 4 (Chords relative to capo)
Am                                     Dm
Sometimes I don't know where this dirty road is taking me
   Am                                Em
Sometimes I don't even know the reason why
 Am
I guess I'll keep a'gambling
       Dm
Lots of booze and lots of rambling
    Am                Em               Am
It's easier than just a-waitin' around to die
Am                          Dm
One-time friends I had a ma, I even had a pa
   Am                                 Em
He beat her with a belt once cause she cried
 Am
She told him to take care of me
       Dm
She headed down to Tennessee
     Am               Em                 Am
It's easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die
Am                                     Dm
I came of age and found a girl in a Tuscaloosa bar
   Am                                Em
She cleaned me out and hit it on the sly
 Am
I tried to kill the pain
       Dm
I bought some wine and hopped a train
    Am                Em               Am
Seemed easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die
Am                                     Dm
A friend said he knew where some easy money was
   Am                                Em
We robbed a man and brother did we fly
 Am
The posse caught up with me
       Dm
Drug me back to Muskogee
    Am                Em               Am
It's two long years, just a-waitin' 'round to die
Am                                     Dm
Now I'm out of prison, I got me a friend at last
   Am                                Em
He don't steal or cheat or drink or lie
 Am
His name's codeine
       Dm
He's the nicest thing I've seen
    Am                Em               Am
Together we're gonna wait around and die

 This Land is Your Land

[Chorus]
G                       D
This land is your land, this land is my land 
        A                      D
From California to the New York Island
                G                         D 
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Verse]
G                      D
As I went walking that ribbon of highway
      A                    D
I saw above me that endless skyway
       G                  D  
I saw below me that golden valley
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Chorus]
G                       D
This land is your land, this land is my land 
        A                      D
From California to the New York Island
                G                         D 
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.

[Verse 2]
G                         D
I roamed and I rambled and I followed my footsteps
                A                    D 
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
          G                    D 
While all around me a voice was sounding
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Chorus]
G                       D
This land is your land, this land is my land 
        A                      D
From California to the New York Island
                G                         D 
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Verse 3]
G                  D
When the sun came shining, and I was strolling
                    A                          D 
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
           G                        D 
A voice was chanting, As the fog was lifting,
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Chorus]
G                       D
This land is your land, this land is my land 
        A                      D
From California to the New York Island
                G                         D 
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Verse 4]
G                    D
As I went walking I saw a sign there
                  A            D 
And on the sign it said "No Trespassing."
          G                        D 
But on the other side it didn't say nothing,
A                              D 
That side was made for you and me.
[Chorus]
G                       D
This land is your land, this land is my land 
        A                      D
From California to the New York Island
                G                         D 
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Verse 5]
G                        D
In the squares of the city, In the shadow of a steeple;
             A                   D 
By the relief office, I'd seen my people.
                   G                     D 
As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking,
A                             D 
Is this land made for you and me?
[Chorus]
G                       D
This land is your land, this land is my land 
        A                      D
From California to the New York Island
                G                         D 
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Verse 6]
G                    D
Nobody living can ever stop me,
       A                    D 
As I go walking that freedom highway;
      G          D
Nobody living can make me turn back
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Chorus]
G                       D
This land is your land, this land is my land 
        A                      D
From California to the New York Island
                G                         D 
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
G                       D
This land is your land, this land is my land 
        A                      D
From California to the New York Island
                G                         D 
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
