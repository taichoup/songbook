E                     A
If you love somebody enough,  
       E
You’ll follow them wherever they go.
                    F#m     A
That’s how I got to Memphis.
                    E
That’s how I got to Memphis.
 
 
[Verse 2]
E                     A
If you love somebody enough, 
            E
Then you’ll go where your heart wants to go.

[Chorus]
B                                A
I know if you’ve seen her you’ll tell me, 
                 E
Cause you are my friend.
B                       A
I’ve got to find her to find out,
                    E  B
What troubles she’s in.
 
 
[Verse 3]
E                        A
If you tell me she’s not here, 
     E
I’ll follow the trail of her tears.
                    F#m     A
That’s how I got to Memphis.
                    E
That’s how I got to Memphis.
 
 
[Verse 4]
E                            A
She use to get mad and she’d say, 
      E
She’d go back to Memphis someday.
                    F#m     A
That’s how I got to Memphis.
                    E
That’s how I got to Memphis.
 
 
[Verse 5]
E                       A
Cause I haven’t eaten a bite,
        E
Haven’t slept in three days or nights.
                    F#m     A
That’s how I got to Memphis.
                    E
That’s how I got to Memphis.
 
 
[Solo]
 
 
[Chorus]
B                        A
I’ve got to find her and tell her,
           E
I love her so.
B                      A
I’ll never rest till I find out,
               E  B
Why she had to go.
 
 
[[Verse 6]
E                           A
Thank you for your precious time.  
          E
Please forgive me if I start to cry.

That’s how I got to Memphis.
                    E
That’s how I got to Memphis.
 
 
[Outro]
                    F#m     A
That’s how I got to Memphis.
                    E
That’s how I got to Memphis.
