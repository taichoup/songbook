Bm   F#   A   E
Bm  F#    A  E
[Verse]
                   Bm        F#       A      E
Find yourself a girl, and settle down
                Bm        F#       A      E
Live a simple life in a quiet town
Bm   F#   A   E
Steady as she goes
                Bm   F#   A   E
Steady as she goes
                   Bm   F#   A   E      Bm   F#   A   E
So steady as she goes
Bm            F#      A      E
Your friends have shown a kink in the single life
                               Bm          F#       A      E
You've had too much to think, now you need a wife
[Chorus]
Bm   F#   A   E
Steady as she goes
                 Bm   F#   A   E
So steady as she goes
                 G
Well here we go again
                    A                          B
You've found yourself a friend that knows you well
                       G
But no matter what you do
                 A         
You'll always feel as though you
            E
Tripped and fell
                    Bm   F#   A   E      Bm   F#   A   E
So steady as she goes
[Verse]
                          Bm           F#           A         E
When you have completed what you thought you had to do
                          Bm            F#          A         E
And your blood's depleted to the point of stable glue
                     Bm   F#   A   E
Then you'll get along
                     Bm   F#   A   E
Then you'll get along
[Chorus]
                 Bm   F#   A   E
Steady as she goes
                    Bm   F#   A   E
So steady as she goes
                  G
Well here we go again
                    A                          B
You've found yourself a friend that knows you well
                      G
But no matter what you do
                 A                           E
You'll always feel as though you tripped and fell
                    Bm   F#   A   E
So steady as she goes
                 Bm   F#   A   E
Steady as she goes
[Verse]
                 Bm          F#       A       E
Settle for a world, neither up or down
                  Bm             F#        A      E
Sell it to the crowd that is gathered round
                Bm          F#       A       E
Settle for a girl, neither up or down
                  Bm             F#        A      E
Sell it to the crowd that is gathered round
[Chorus]
                   Bm   F#   A   E
So steady as she goes
                 Bm   F#   A   E
Steady as she goes
                Bm   F#   A   E
Steady as she goes
                  Bm   F#   A   E
So steady as she goes
               Bm           F#          A        E
Steady as she goes, are you steady now?
               Bm           F#          A        E
Steady as she goes, are you steady now?
               Bm           F#          A        E 
Steady as she goes, are you steady now?
               Bm           F#          A        E
Steady as she goes, are you steady now?
               Bm
Steady as she goes
