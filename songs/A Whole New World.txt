[Verse]

D     D/G           D
I can show you the world
D         D/G        Bm   A/C#
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Em       F#7           Bm
Tell me, princess, now when did
Bm/A     G                 D
You last let your heart decide?

D     D/G         D
I can open your eyes
D        D/G       Bm  A/C#
Take you wonder by wonder
Em     F#7          Bm
Over, sideways and under
Bm/A   G           D
On a magic carpet ride


[Chorus]

G             A   D
A whole new world
G        A/C#      A+B auric.   Bm
A new fantastic point of        view
          G      D/F#
No one to tell us no
    G      D/F#
Or where to go
  Bm7       E7    A
Or say we're only dreaming

G             A   D
A whole new world
G         A/C#     A+B auric.   Bm
A dazzling place I never        knew
D7           G      D/F#
But when I'm way up here
     G       D/F#
It's crystal clear
    Bm7     E7   C          A7         D
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
D      
Now I'm in a whole new world with you


[Verse]

F    F/Bb     F
Unbelievable sights
F     F/Bb   Dm  C/E
Indescribable feeling
Gm        A7              Dm
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Dm/C        Bb              F
Through an endless diamond sky


[Chorus]

Bb            C                              F
A whole new world (Don't you dare close your eyes)
Bb          C/E       A      Dm
A hundred thousand things to see (Hold your breath - it gets better)
           Bb       F/A
I'm like a shooting star
     Bb     F/A
I've come so far
 Dm7      G7      C
I can't go back to where I used to be

Bb               C
A whole new world (Every turn a surprise)
Bb           C     A Dm
With new horizons to pursue (Every moment red-letter)
F7              Bb   F/A
I'll chase them anywhere
        Bb       F/A
There's time to spare
Dm7      G7        Eb         C7         F
Let me share this whole new world with you


[Outro]

   Bb        C     
A whole new world
        Bb        C
That's where we'll be
    Bb        C
A thrilling chase
  Bb           C
A wonderous place
    C7      F
For you and me
