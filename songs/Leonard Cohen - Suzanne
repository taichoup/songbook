Leonard Cohen - Suzanne

[Verse 1]

  E

Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river

        F#m

You can hear the boats go by, you can spend the night beside her

        E

And you know that she's half-crazy, but that's why you wanna be there

        G#m                                 A

And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China

        E                                   F#m

And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her

         E                                   F#m

Then she gets you on her wavelength, and she lets the river answer

            E

That you've always been her lover



[Chorus 1]

        G#m                              A

And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind

        E                                  F#m

And you know she will trust you for you've touched her perfect body

          E

With your mind



[Verse 2]

    E

And Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water

       F#m

And he spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower

    E

And when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him

          G#m                            A

He said: "All men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them"

    E                            F#m

But he himself was broken long before the sky would open

   E                       F#m

Forsaken, almost human, he sank beneath your wisdom

       E

Like a stone



[Chorus 2]

        G#m                              A

And you want to travel with him, and you want to travel blind

        E                                     F#m

And you think maybe you'll trust him for he's touched your perfect body

         E

With his mind



[Verse 3]

      E

Now Suzanne takes your hand, and she leads you to the river

       F#m

She is wearing rags and feathers from the Salvation Army counter

        E

And the sun pours down like honey on Our Lady of the Harbour

        G#m                               A

And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers

         E                                 F#m

There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning

         E                                   F#m

They are leaning out for love, and they will lean that way forever

        E

While Suzanne holds the mirror



[Chorus 3]

        G#m                              A

And you want to travel with her, and you want to travel blind

        E                                     F#m

And you know that you can trust her for she's touched your perfect body

         E

With her mind
