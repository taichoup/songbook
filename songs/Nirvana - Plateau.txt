Nirvana - Plateau

Tuning: Eb

[Intro]
(riff)


[Verse]

G                                    Bb          Fsus2
Many a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateau
G              Bb            Fsus2
Some belong to strangers and some to folks you know
G                                   Bb            Fsus2
Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand
G                                    Bb        Fsus2
To beautify the foothills and shake the many hands

G#


[Chorus]

G                            Bb         Fsus2
The nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
G                  Bb         Fsus2
And an illustrated book about birds
G                          Bb       Fsus2
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
G                     Bb      Fsus2
Who needs action when you got words

riff


[Verse]

G                             Bb               Fsus2
When you've finished with the mop then you can stop
G           Bb          Fsus2
And look at what you've done
G                    Bb            Fsus2
The plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen
G       Bb          Fsus2
And the work it was fun


[Chorus]

G                            Bb         Fsus2
The nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
G                  Bb         Fsus2
And an illustrated book about birds
G                          Bb       Fsus2
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
G                     Bb      Fsus2
Who needs action when you got words

riff


[Verse]

G                            Bb                       Fsus2
Well the many hands began to scan around for the next plateau
G                   Bb                     Fsus2
Some said it was in Greenland and some say Mexico
G                     Bb                           Fsus2
Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood
G                       Bb                               Fsus2
But those were all just guesses, wouldn't help you if they could
