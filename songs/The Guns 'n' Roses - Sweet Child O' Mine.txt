The Guns 'n' Roses - Sweet Child O' Mine


[Verse]

D  
He's got a smile that it seems to me 
C9  
Reminds me of childhood memories 
     G  
Where  everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky 
D 
Now and then when I see his face 
C9 
It takes me away to that special place 
        G                                           D  
and if I   stay too long I'd probably break down and  cry 

[Chorus]

C9  G                      D   
Oh     oh, sweet child of     mine 
C9       G                     D  
Oh, oh,     oh, sweet love of     mine 

[Verse]

D  
He's got eyes of the bluest sky 
C9 
and if they thought of rain 
    G                                    D   
I'd     hate to look into those eyes and     see an ounce of pain 
D  
His hair reminds me of a warm safe place 
C9 
where as a child I'd hide 
    G                                           D   
and     pray for the thunder and for the rain to   quietly pass me by 

[Chorus]

C9  G                      D   
Oh     oh, sweet child of     mine 
C9       G                     D  
Oh, oh,     oh, sweet love of     mine 
 C9          G                     D   
Oh, oh, oh,     oh sweet child of     mine 
             C9      G               D   
Hey, hey-hey     Oh    sweet love of mine
