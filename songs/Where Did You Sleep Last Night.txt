Em              Am          G            B7


[Verse]

Em                     Am      G
My girl, my girl don't lie to me
B7                               Em
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
Em                                     Am              G
In the palace, in the palace where the sun don't ever shine
B7                           Em
I'll shiver the whole night through
Em                     Am         G
My girl, my girl, where will you go
B7                            Em
I'm going where the cold wind blows
Em
In the pines, in the pines

[Chorus]

         Am             G
Where the sun don't ever shine
B7                             Em
I would shiver the whole night through
Em                     Am       G
Her husband, was a hard working man
B7                     Em
Just about a mile from here
Em                     Am       G
His head was found in a driving wheel
B7                     Em
But his body never was found
Em                      Am      G
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
B7                               Em
Tell me where did you sleep last night
Em
In the pines, in the pines
         Am              G
Where the sun don't ever shine
B7                             Em
I would shiver the whole night through


[Verse]

Em                     Am         G
My girl, my girl, where will you go
B7                            Em
I'm going where the cold wind blows
Em                      Am      G
My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
B7                               Em
Tell me where did you sleep last night
Em
In the pines, in the pines
         Am              G
Where the sun don't ever shine
B7                             Em
I would shiver the whole night through
