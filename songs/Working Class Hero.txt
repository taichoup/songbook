[Intro]

 Am  


[Verse 1]

  Am                       G             Am
As soon as you're born they make you feel small
  Am                    G          Am
By giving you no time instead of it all
        Am                      G          Am
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
 Am                    G            Am
A working class hero is something to be
 Am            G       D            Am
A working class hero is something to be


[Verse 2]

    Am                        G          Am
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
    Am                                 G         Am
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
           Am                         G            Am
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
 Am                    G            Am
A working class hero is something to be
 Am            G       D            Am
A working class hero is something to be


[Verse 3]

            Am                          G          Am
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
Am                      G        Am
Then they expect you to pick a career
        Am                           G          Am
When you can't really function you're so full of fear
 Am                    G            Am
A working class hero is something to be
 Am            G       D            Am
A working class hero is something to be


[Verse 4]

        Am                      G         Am
Keep you doped with religion and sex and T.V.
       Am                         G             Am
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
          Am                        G            Am
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
 Am                    G            Am
A working class hero is something to be
 Am            G       D            Am
A working class hero is something to be


[Verse 5]

       Am                       G           Am
There's room at the top they are telling you still
   Am                          G            Am
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
      Am                  G            Am
If you want to be like the folks on the hill
 Am                    G            Am
A working class hero is something to be
 Am            G       D            Am
A working class hero is something to be


[Outro]

      Am                     G           Am
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
      Am                     G           D          Am
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
