Capo 3

------

[Intro]

C

[Verse 1]

  C       Am         Em

Crimson flames tied through my ears

     F            G       C

Rollin' high and mighty traps

 C            Am       Em     C

Pounced with fire on flaming roads

  F         Em     G

Using ideas as my maps

        F      Am       G         C

"We'll meet on edges, soon," said I

 Am                   F      G

Proud 'neath heated brow.

     C                 Am     C

Ah, but I was so much older then,

     F        G        C

I'm younger than that now.

[Instrumental]

G    G    G    G

[Verse 2]

  C            Am     Em

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth

   F           G          C

"Rip down all hate," I screamed

 C        Am       Em

Lies that life is black and white

F                        G

Spoke from my skull. I dreamed

   Am              Em

Romantic facts of musketeers

     F                  G

Foundationed deep, somehow.

        C      Am     Em      F

Ah, but I was so much older then,

     G                C

I'm younger than that now.

[Verse 3]

    C         Am         Em

Girls' faces formed the forward path

       F    G     C

From phony jealousy

    C   Am     Em

To memorizing politics

   F             G

Of ancient history

    Am                 Em

Flung down by corpse evangelists

    F                      G

Unthought of, though, somehow.

      C               F       C

Ah, but I was so much older then,

     F        G        C

I'm younger than that now.

[Verse 4]

   C      Am        Em

A self-ordained professor's tongue

    F    G      C

Too serious to fool

  C      Am      Em

Spouted out that liberty

    F                  G

Is just equality in school

   Am           Em

"Equality," I spoke the word

   F             G

As if a wedding vow.

       C      Am

Ah, but I was so much older then,

 F           G         C

I'm younger than that now.

[Verse 5]

      C          Am        Em

In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand

        F       G         C

At the mongrel dogs who teach

 C                 Am         Em

Fearing not that I'd become my enemy

        F               G

In the instant that I preach

    Am                F        C

My existence led by confusion boats

 Am          Em       G

Mutiny from stern to bow.

        C      Am      F     C

Ah, but I was so much older then,

     G                 C

I'm younger than that now.

[Verse 6]

         C       Am            Em

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats

     F     G     C

Too noble to neglect

    C        Am    Em

Deceived me into thinking

       F               G

I had something to protect

 Am                Em

Good and bad, I define these terms

 F                        G

Quite clear, no doubt, somehow.

        C     Am       F      C

Ah, but I was so much older then,

      G                C

I'm younger than that now.
