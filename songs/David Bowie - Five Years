David Bowie - Five Years


G*
Pushing Through the Market Square
Em
So many mothers sighing
A
News had just come over
C/G
We had 5 years left to cry in


 News guy wept and told us
 earth eas really dying
 Cried so much, his face was wet
 Then i knew he was not lying.



 G Am   G
 I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies
   Bm  Em
 I saw boys, toys, electric irons and T.V's
    A
 My brain hurt like a ware house, it had no room to spare
           C
 I had to cram so many things to store ev'ry thing in there




                             Am      C/G
And all the fat-skinny people,

                             Am      C/G
and all the tall-short people
                             G*      C/G
And all the nobody people,

                             D
and all the somebody people


I never thought I'd need so many people C/G  G


Repeat the 4 chords now for the rest of the song with the strumming pattern
D DUDU X4 for each chord which starts with the normal G after "i never thought i'd need 

many people."



G*

A girl my age went off her head,

Em
hit some tiny children
A
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off,

C/G
I think she would have killed them


 A soldier with a broken arm
 Fixed his state to the wheels of a Cadilac
 A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
 And a queer threw up at at the sight of that


 I think i saw you in an ice cream parlor
 Drinking milkshakes cold and long
 smiling and waving and looking so fine
 Don't think you knew you were in this song


 And it was cold, and it rained, so i felt like an actor
 And i thought of Ma, and i wanted to get back there
 Your face, Your race, the way that you talk
 I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk. we got


G*
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Em
Five years, what a surprise
A
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
C/G
Five years, that's all we've got
