G                               F    D  

Slipping and slidin, and playin dominoes

G                                     F         D    

Lefting and then righting; it's not a crime you know.

    A                     G                F       D  

You gotta tell your story boy, before it's time to go.



        G                                   F       D                 

Are you ready for the country, because it's time to go?            

        G                                   F       D                 

Are you ready for the country, because it's time to go?

      G                                     F     D 

I was talkin' to the preacher, said God was on my side

       G                                  F       D

Then I ran into the hangman, he said it's time to die

    A                     G                 F      D

You gotta tell your story boy, you know the reason why.



        G                                   F       D                 

Are you ready for the country, because it's time to go?

Are you ready for the country, because it's time to go?
