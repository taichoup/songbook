Neil Young - Tell Me Why

[Verse]

 C                          

  Sailing heartships through

 D              

 Broken harbours

 Am7       (C) 

 Out on the waves

        G     (C)(G)     C

 In the night  

C

 Still the searcher must

D

 Ride the dark horse

Am

 Racing along

G

 In his stride

 [Chorus]

 D       Am7  C  G C G D

 Tell me why           

         Am7   C   G

 Tell me why      

 

       Bm                                 C   

 Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself

             D               C  

 When you're old enough to repay

          Bm7             Em  

 But young enough to sell

 C D Am7 (C) G

[Verse]

C

 Tell me lies later

D

 Come and see me

Am                   G

 I'll be around for a while

C

 I am lonely but

D

 You can free me

Am                       G

 All in the way that you smile

[Chorus]

 D       Am7  C  G C G D

 Tell me why           

         Am7   C   G

 Tell me why      

 

       Bm                                 C   

 Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself

             D               C  

 When you're old enough to repay

          Bm7             Em  

 But young enough to sell

 C D Am7 (C) G

 C D Am7 (C) G

       

 [Chorus]

 D       Am7  C  G C G D

 Tell me why           

         Am7   C   G

 Tell me why      

 

       Bm                                 C   

 Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself

             D               C  

 When you're old enough to repay

          Bm7             Em  

 But young enough to sell

 C D Am7 (C) G   (to fade)

      

 notes:

           

 The Bm7 xx4232 is suspect, try a straight D (works better

 than A GM7)
