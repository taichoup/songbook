John Lennon - Cold Turkey



Am                  D7

Temperature`s rising

Am           D7

Fever is high

Am                 D7

Can`t see no future

Am              D7

Can`t see no sky

Am                  D7

My feet are so heavy

Am                 D7

I wish I was a baby

Am              D7   

I was I was dead



Chorus:

     C          Dsus4         Am   

Cold turkey has got me on the run

     C          Dsus4         Am   

Cold turkey has got me on the run
