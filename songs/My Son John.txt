My son John was tall and slim
And he'd a leg for ev'ry limb
But now he's got no legs at all
For he ran a race with a cannon ball

Timmy roo dun da, fadda riddle da
Whack fo' the riddle Timmy roo dun da

Well were ya drunk or were ya blind
When ya left your two fine legs behind
Or was it sailin' on the sea
Wore your two fine legs right down to the knee

I was not drunk, I was not blind
When I left my two fine legs behind
Nor was it sailin' on the sea
Wore my two fine legs right down to the knee

Each foreign war I'll now denounce
â€˜tween the King of England and the King of France
For I'd rather my legs as they used to be
Than the king of Spain and his whole navy

I was tall and I was slim
And I'd a leg for ev'ry limb
But now I've got no legs at all
They were both shot away by a cannon ball

I was tall and I was slim
And I'd a leg for ev'ry limb
But now I've got no legs at all
They done come off on a cannon ball
