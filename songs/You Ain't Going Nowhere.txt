[Verse]

D                           Em            G              
Clouds  so   swift,  rain   fallin' in,   gonna   see   a
               D                               
movie   called  Gunga Din.  Pack  up  your money,  put
        Em                     G                       D     
up your  tent  in   the  wind,  you  ain't  a-goin' no  where.

[Chorus]

       D       Em                G       
       Ooo-ee! Ride  me   high,  tomorrow's  the
                 D                               
       day   my  bride's a-gonna come.   Oh, oh,
             Em               G                       D
       are   we  gonna  fly   down  into   the  easy  chair.

[Verse]

D                      Em            G       
Genghis Khan and  his  brother Don,  couldn't  keep
   D                                       Em     
on  keepin' on  We'll  climb  that  bridge  after   it's
        G                         D                     
gone.    After  we're  way  past  it.
       
[Chorus]

       D       Em                G       
       Ooo-ee! Ride   me  high,  tomorrow's  the
                    D                               
       day     my   bride's a-gonna come.  Oh, oh,
              Em               G                     D
       are    we   gonna  fly  down  into the  easy  chair.

[Verse]

D                               Em                   G
Buy  me   some  rings  and  a   gun  that  sings  a  flute
                    D               
that  toots  and  a  bee  that  stings,  sky  that  cries
        Em                     G                          D
and  a   bird  that  flies,  a  fish  that  walks  and  a  dog that talks.

[Chorus]

D       Em                G       
       
Ooo-ee! Ride   me   high, tomorrow's    he
          D                               
day   my   bride's a-gonna come.   Oh,  oh,
     Em               G                      D
are   we   gonna  fly  down  into  the  easy  chair.
