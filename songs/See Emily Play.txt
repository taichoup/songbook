G                  Asus4     Am       Em
  Emily tries but misunderstands, ah ooh

[Verse 2]
G                 Asus4    Am     Em
Soon after dark  Emily cries, ah ooh
Cmaj7   
Gazing through trees in sorrow
Am                      G 
Hardly a sound till tomorrow 

[Chorus]
            E           D               E
There is no other day   let’s  try it another way 
D                          E
You’ll lose your mind and play  
     A                            G
