Aerosmith - I Don't Want To Miss A Thing

[Piano Intro]

[Verse]

D          A                   Bm
I could stay awake just to hear you breathing
          G                   D                  Em
Watch you smile while you are sleeping while your far away
A
dreaming
        D            A            Bm
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
       G                D        Em   A
I could stay lost in this moment forever
             A         G                  D    A
Every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

[Chorus]

D                        A
       I don't want to close my eyes
Em                                              Bm
       I don't want to fall asleep 'cause I'd miss you baby
      G                      D
and I don't want to miss a thing
D                           A
       'cause even when I dream of you
Em                                                  Bm
       the sweetest dream will never do I'd still miss you baby

and I don't want to miss a thing
