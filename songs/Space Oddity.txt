[Verse 1]

C                        Em Em7  C                       Em Em7
Ground control to Major Tom,     Ground control to Major Tom:
Am        Am7/G             D7/#F
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
C                      Em  Em7    C                             Em Em7
Ground control to Major Tom:      Commencing countdown engine's on
Am       Am7/G          D7/#F
Check ig-nition and may God's love be with you


[Chorus]

C                               E7                          F
This is ground control to Major Tom, you've really made the grade!
        Fm             C/E                   F     
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear, 
        Fm                C/E            F
now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
C                               E7                             F
This is Major Tom to ground con-trol, I'm stepping through the door
       Fm              C/E           F   
And I'm floating in the most peculiar way 
       Fm              C/E         F
and the stars look very different today
      

[Bridge]

  Fmaj7     Em7                   Fmaj7         Em7
For here am I sitting in a tin can, far above the world
Bbmaj7          Am               G             F
Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do

[Verse 2]

C                                      E7                      F
Though I'm passed one hundred thousand miles, I'm feeling very still
     Fm                 C/E                F
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go, 
      Fm              C             F
tell my wife I love her very much she knows


[Chorus]

G                 E7
Ground control to Major Tom: 
     Am                      Am7/G
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong.
       D7/#F                
Can you hear me Major Tom? 
       C/G
Can you hear me Major Tom? 
       G
Can you hear me Major Tom? Can you ...


[Bridge]

Fmaj7     Em7                   Fmaj7         Em7
here am floating in my tin can, far above the moon
Bbmaj7          Am               G             F
Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do
