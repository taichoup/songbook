[Verse 1]

CAPO:  6

Am                       G
Hello darkness, my old friend,
                          Am
I've come to talk with you again,
                 F     C          
Because a vision softly creeping,
        Am             F     C                  
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
        F                               C    
And the vision that was planted in my brain
      Am       
Still remains
            G       Am               
Within the sound of silence.


[Verse 2]

Am                          G         
In restless dreams I walked alone
                       Am
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
Am                 F        C
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
             Am           F        C
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
       F                                         C     
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
              Am
That split the night
               G        Am
And touched the sound of silence.


[Verse 3]

Am                         G
And in the naked light I saw
                          Am
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
Am                F       C
People talking without speaking,
Am                    F       C
People hearing without listening,
                F                       C
People writing songs that voices never share
          Am
And no one dare
            G        Am
Disturb the sound of silence.


[Verse 4]

Am                         G
Fools said I, you do not know
                     Am
Silence like a cancer grows.
Am                     F          C
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Am                    F           C
Take my arms that I might reach you.
        F                          C
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
     Am
And echoed
      G        Am
In the wells of silence


[Verse 5]

Am                        G
And the people bowed and prayed
                    Am
To the neon God they made.
Am                         F      C
And the sign flashed out its warning,
Am                     F     C
In the words that it was forming.
        Am              F
And the sign said, the words of the prophets
       F                    C
Are written on the subway walls
              Am
And tenement halls.
                     G         Am      
And whispered in the sounds of silence.
