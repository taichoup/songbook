As Good As I Once Was

Tab author: "I've seen this done with the same chord with a capo on two, but I like it better this
way, trey both and see wich you like better."

INTRO: C D G

VERSE:
                        C             D
She said, "I seen you in here before."
                      G                       
I said, "I been here a time or two."
                         C             D
She said,"Hello my name is Bobby Jo,
                   G
meet my twin sister betty lou.
                            C          D
And we're both feelin' kinda wild tonight,
                      G
you're the only cowboy in this place.
                     A
And if you're up for a rodeo,
                    D
I'll put a big texas smile on your face."

I said "girls....."

CHORUS:
                    C                 D
I ain't as good as I once was
           G
I got a few years on me now
               C              D
But there was a time, back in my prime
                   G
When I could really lay it down
                C                       D
If you need some love tonight
                 G    G/B  Em
Then I might have just enough
                    C                  
I ain't as good as I once was,
          D                C            G
But I'm as good, once, as I ever was

BREAK C D G

VERSE:
                        C             D
I still hang out with my best friend Dave
                      G                       
I've known him since we were kids at school
                         C             D
Last night he had a few shots,
            G
Got in a tight spot
                  C          D
Hustlin' a game of pool
                      G
With a couple of redneck boys
                     A
One great big fat biker man
                    D
I David yell across the room

"Hey buddy, how bout a helpin' hand?"

I said Dave.....

CHORUS:
                    C                 D
I ain't as good as I once was
           G
My how the years have flown
               C              D
But there was a time, back in my prime
                   G
When I could really hold my own
                C                       D
If you want to fight tonigh
                                G    G/B  Em
Guess those boys don't look all that tough
                    C
I ain't as good as I once was,
          D                C            G
But I'm as good, once, as I ever was

BRIDGE:
            F             C
I used to be hell on wheels
                 G
Back when I was a younger man
                 A
Now my body say's you can't do this boy
                     D
But my pride say's oh yes you can

CHORUS:
                    C                 D
I ain't as good as I once was
           G
Thats just the cold hard truth
                             C              D
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
                   G
When I'm feelin bullet proof
                C                       D
So don't double dog dare me now
                           G    G/B  Em
Cause I'd have to call your bluff
                    C
I ain't as good as I once was,
          D                C            G
But I'm as good, once, as I ever was

TURNAROUND
                    C
Hey, I ain't as good as I once was
          D                C            G
But I'm as good, once, as I ever was

ENDING C D G
