[Verse 1]



D

Left a good job in the city, workin for the man every night and day



and I never lost one minute of sleepin', worryin' 'bout the way things might

            A                                  Bm

have been.  Big wheel a-keep on turnin'  Proud    Mary keep on burnin',

     D

Roll - in', rollin', rollin' on the river





[Verse 2]



D

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis, pumped a lot of pane down in New



Orleans,  But I never saw the good side of the city, till I hitched a ride

                       A                                 Bm

on a river boat queen. Big wheel a-keep on turnin,  Proud  Mary keep on

             D

burnin, roll - in, rollin, rollin on the river





[Instrumental]

[Short Chorus]



    D

rol - lin, rollin, rollin on the river



[Verse 3]



D

if you come down to the river, bet you're gonna find some people who live,

D

you don't have to worry, cause you have no money, people on the river are

                A                              Bm

happy to give.  Big wheel keep on turnin, Proud  Mary keep on burnin,

    D

roll - in,  rollin,  rollin on the river

    D

roll - in,  rollin,  rollin on the river

    D

roll - in,  rollin,  rollin on the river (fades out)
