Am                 Am/g  Am/f   C/g
The shack is falling in and your wrists are getting thin
                                                      E7
Sweetheart you don’t deserve the kind of live I put you in
        Am            Am/g Am/f          C/g
But it’s hard to draw a pay when my papers always say
                                                      E7
That I took a loaf of bread from the grocery store one day
      Am        Am/g Am/f  C/g
For my time behind bars you have to bear the scars
                                                      E7
When people down the road can drive ten thousand dollar cars


        Am            Am/g Am/f  C/g
So it’s a long long hard way to the East Colorado Dam
                                           E7
If I make it to Saint Louis, I’ll send you a telegram
Am                 Am/g   Am/f  C/g
If I don’t make it at all, you’ll know why I didn’t call
                                 E7                Am    (G F C)
Just kiss the baby for me and come see my grave next fall


The weather’s getting warmer and the baby’s coming soon
I’ll try to find some work that might carry us through to June
But everywhere’s the same when you’re a man without a name
They’ll make you feel so useless and then wonder why you came
If a soul-searching beggar is what I was meant to be
I’d rather rock behind the walls of your penitentiary


So it’s a long long hard way to the East Colorado Dam
If I make it to Saint Louis, I’ll send you a telegram
If I don’t make it at all, you’ll know why I didn’t call
Just kiss the baby for me and come see my grave next fall


You say you love me now like you always did before
And I love just as well but I just can’t keep you down no more
So I’ll be leaving in the morning if the weather’s bad or good
And let you find a man who’ll give you all the things I never could
But I’ll never understand as long as I live
How we can talk of love our neighbor yet we can never forgive


So it’s a long long hard way to the East Colorado Dam
If I make it to Saint Louis, I’ll send you a telegram
If I don’t make it at all, you’ll know why I didn’t call
Just kiss the baby for me and come see my grave next fall
