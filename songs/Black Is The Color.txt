Capo at 1st Fret (Christy Mack and Hamish Imlach version)




Am               F        G            Am
Black is the colour of my true love's hair.

            F         G      E7               
Her lips are like some roses fair.

                    F             G        E7
She's the sweetest smile and the gentlest hands.

            F      G              Am
I love the ground     where on she stands.


I love my love - well she knows.
I love the ground where on she goes.
I wish the day it soon would come
when she and I could be as one.

I go to the Clyde and mourn and weep
Satisfied I never can be.
I write her a letter, just a few short lines
And suffer death a thousand times.

For black is the colour of my true love's hair.
Her lips are like a rose so fair.
She hast the sweetest smile and the gentlest hands.
I love the ground where on she stands.
