[Intro]

 Bb F C G Bb Dm



[Verse]             

 Dm                        C/D        

 My life is changin' in so many ways

         Bb                   F   

 I don't know who to trust anymore

 Dm                       C/D              

 There's a shadow runnin' through my days

        Bb                        Dm  

 Like a beggar goin' from door to door





       Dm                            C/D   

 I was thinkin' that maybe I'd get a maid

        Bb                      F   

 Find a place nearby for her to stay

 Dm                      Am7/D          

 Just someone to keep my house clean -

        Bb            Dm  

 Fix my meals and go away.





[Chorus]

   Dm C/D  Bb                Dm7   G F Em7

 A maid       A man needs a maid.     



   Dm C/D  Bb Dm

 A maid     



 G F Em7 F C 

             





[Verse]

      Am   G  F    Em7  Dm7   

 It's hard to make that change

      Am   G   F    Em7  Dm7     GaddC D    Bb F

 When life and love turn strange and   cold    

    C            G          Bb           F

 To give a love,  you gotta live a love.  

    C            G          Bb          F

 To live a love,  you gotta be part of. 

 C                    G     Bb Dm

 When will I see you again?    





 Dm                                 C/D   

 A while ago somewhere I don't know when

       Bb                      F      

 I was watching a movie with a friend.

 Dm                      Am7/D     

 I fell in love with the actress.

         Bb                               Dm    

 She was playin' a part that I could understand 





[Chorus]

   Dm C/D  Bb                Dm7   G F Em7

 A maid      A man needs a maid.     



   Dm C/D  Bb              

 A maid      A man needs 



   Gm    Dm Em Em7

 A maid.       



 C           G        Bb    Dm     

 When will I see you again?  (hold)
