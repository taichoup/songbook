[Verse]

A              E
  there was a time
F#m              C#m
  when I was so broken-hearted
D              A         E
  love wasn't much of a friend of mine
A                  E
  the tables have turned, yeah
F#m                   C#
  'cause me and them ways have parted
D               A            E
  that kind of love was the killin' kind -- listen
[Prechorus]
G        D           G             D
  all I want is someone I can't resist
C              G                    E
  I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed

[Chorus]

        A             E
  I was cryin' when I met you
          F#m          D

A          E          D
  love is sweet misery
        A              E
  I was cryin' just to get you
          C#m            D

Bb5 C5 F5 G5
            now there's not even breathin' room
Bb5 C5 F5 G5
            between pleasure and pain
Bb5 C5 F5 G5
            yeah, you cry when we're makin' love
Bb5 C5 F5 G5                     Bb5
            must be one and the same

[Verse]

A               E
  it's down on me
  F#m           C#m
  yeah I got to tell you one thing
D                    A            E
  that's been on my mind, girl I gotta say
A                    E
  we're partners in crime
F#m          C#
you got that certain something
D                   A           E
  what you give to me takes my breath away
[Prechorus]
          G               D             G               D
  now the word out on the street is the devil's in your kiss
C                   G                   E
  if our love goes up in flames it's a fire I can't resist
