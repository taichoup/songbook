ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER                (Bob Dylan)

            Am                G                F           G   Am  
           (play it forever)
               There must be some kind of way out of here

               Said the joker to the thief

               There's too much confusion

               I can't get no relief

               Buisness men they drink my wine

               Plowmen dig my earth

               None would ever compromise

               Nobody of this world

               No reason to get excited

               The thief he kindly spoke

               There are many here among us

               Who feel that life is but a joke

               But you and I we've been through that

               And this is not our place

               So let us stop talking falsely now

               The hour's getting late

               All along the watchtower

               Princess kept the view

               While all the women came and went

               Barefoot servants too

              Outside in the cold distance

               A wildcat did growl

               Two riders were approaching

               And the wind began to howl

               All along the watchtower

               All along the watchtower

               All along the watchtower
