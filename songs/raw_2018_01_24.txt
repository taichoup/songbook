Tell You a little story and it won't take long,
'Bout a lazy farmer who wouldn't hoe his corn.
The reason why I never could tell,
That young man was always well.


He planted his corn in the month of June.
By July it was up to his eyes.
Come September, came a big frost.
And all the young man's corn was lost.


His courtship had just begun.
Said: "Young man, have you hoed some corn?"
"Well I tried and I tried, and I tried in vain.
"But I don't believe I raised one grain."


He went down town to his neighbour's door.
Where he had often been before.
Sayin': "Pretty little miss, will you marry me?"
"Little miss what do you say?"


"Why do you come for me to wed?
"You, can't even make your own corn grain.
"Single I am, and will remain.
"A lazy man, I won't maintain."


He turned his back and walked away.
Saying: "Little miss, you'll rue the day.
"You'll rue the day that you were born.
"For givin' me the devil 'cos I wouldn't hoe corn."

D                                G
Well, you wake up in the mornin'
                           D
You hear the work bell ring
                               A7
And they march you to the table

Ain't no food upon the table
                        D
And no fork up in the pan
                                 A7
But you'd better not complain, boy
                              D
You'll get in trouble with the man

By the way she wears her apron
                     D
And the clothes she wore
                     G
Umbrella on her shoulder
                       D
Piece of paper in her hand
                        A7

                       D
And you'd better not fight
                        G
Or the sheriff will grab ya

Tonalité originale : D


Am           Dm        Am 
Le roi a fait battre tambour (bis)
G                  C   G   Em 
Pour voir toutes ces da-a-ames
Am             Em    Am 
Et la première qu'il a vue
        Dm   Am   Em   Am 
Lui a ravi son â-âme.

- Marquis, dis-moi, la connais-tu ? (bis)
Qui est cette jolie dame
Le marquis lui a répondu:
- Sire roi, c'est ma femme.

- Marquis, tu es plus heureux qu'moi (bis)
D'avoir femme si belle
Si tu voulais me l'accorder
Je me chargerais d'elle.

- Sire, si vous n'étiez pas le roi (bis)
J'en tirerais vengeance
Mais puisque vous êtes le roi
A votre obéissance.

- Marquis, ne te fâche donc pas (bis)
T'auras ta récompense
Je te ferai dans mes armées
Beau maréchal de France.

- Adieu, ma mie, adieu, mon coeur (bis)
Adieu mon espérance !
Puisqu'il nous faut servir le roi
Séparons-nous d'ensemble.

Le roi l'a prise par la main (bis)
L'a menée en sa chambre
La belle en montant les degrés
A voulu se défendre.

Marquise, ne pleurez pas tant (bis) 
Je vous ferai princesse
De tout mon or et mon argent
Vous serez la maîtresse.

Gardez votre or et votre argent (bis)
N'appartiennent qu'à la reine 
J'aimerai mieux mon doux marquis 
Que toutes vos richesses 

La reine a fait faire un bouquet (bis)
De belles fleurs de lys-e
Et la senteur de ce bouquet
A fait mourir marquise.

Je m'souviens comme elle pleurait
Elle voulait pas que je sorte.

Toujours, toujours elle disait
T'en va pas chez les filles
Fais donc pas toujours c'qui t'plaît
Dans les prisons y'a des grilles.
J'ai pas tué, j'ai pas volé
Mais j'ai cru Madeleine
J'ai pas tué, j'ai pas volé
J'voulais pas lui faire de peine.

Je m'souviens, ma mère disait
Suis pas les Bohémiennes
Je m'souviens comme elle disait
On ramasse les gens qui traînent
Un jour, les soldats du roi
T'emmèn'ront aux galères
Tu t'en iras trois par trois
Comme ils ont emmené ton père.

Tu auras la tête rasée
On te mettra des chaînes
T'en auras les reins brisés
Et moi, j'en mourrai de peine
Toujours, toujours tu ram'ras
Quand tu s'ras aux galères
Toujours, toujours tu ram'ras
Tu pens'ras p't'être à ta mère.

J'ai pas tué, j'ai pas volé
Mais j'ai pas cru ma mère
Et je m'souviens qu'elle m'aimait
Pendant que j'rame aux galères.

Alison Krauss & The Union Station's version


Drop D Tuning


Dm                                        Bb
Tell you a little story and it won't take long
C                                        Dm
'Bout a lazy farmer who wouldn't hoe his corn
Dm                           Bb
The reason why I never could tell
C                         Dm
That young man was always well




He planted his corn in the month of June
By July it was up to his eyes
Come September there came a big frost
And all the young man's corn was lost




His courtship had just begun
Said young man, "Have you hauled some corn?"
"Well I tried and I tried and I tried in vain,
But I don't believe I raised one grain."




Well he went down town to his neighbor's door
Where he had often been before
Sayin "Pretty little miss will you marry me,
Little miss what do you say?"




"Why do you come for me to wed?
You can't even make your own cornbread
Single I am and will remain.
A lazy man I won't maintain."




He turned his back and walked away
Sayin "Little miss you'll rue the day.
You'll rue the day that you were born
Givin me the devil cause I wouldn't hoe corn."

You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive

Verse 1:
       Em         G        D          A
In the deep, dark hills of eastern Kentucky
           Em             G            C
That's the place where I trace my bloodline
         C      G         D         A
And it’s there I read on a hillside gravestone
         C          B7      Em
You will never leave Harlan alive

Verse 2:
Well my granddad’s dad walked down Katahrins Mountain
And he asked Tillie Helton to be his bride
Said, won’t you walk with me out of the mouth of this holler
Or we’ll never leave Harlan alive

Chorus:
                   G        C  D       G
Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
            Em             C    G      C
And the sun goes down about three in the day
                  G                 C      D          G
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you’re drinkin’
                   Em                   C          Em
And you spend your life just thinkin’ of how to get away

Verse 3:
No one ever knew there was coal in them mountains
‘Til a man from the Northeast arrived
Waving hundred dollar bills said, I’ll pay you for your minerals
But he never left Harlan alive

C   B7   Em

Verse 4:
Granny sold out cheap and they moved out west of Pineville
To a farm where big Richland River winds
I bet they danced them a jig, laughed and sang a new song
Who said we’d never leave Harlan alive

Instrumental Break: (same chords as verse)

Verse 5:
But the times they got hard and tobacco wasn’t selling
And ole granddad knew what he’d do to survive
He went and dug for Harlan coal and sent the money back to granny
But he never left Harlan alive

Repeat Chorus (last chord changes from Dm to F)

Last Chorus:
                   G        C  D       G
Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
            Em             C    G      C
And the sun goes down about three in the day
                  G                 C      D          G
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you’re drinkin’
                   Em                         C             Em
And you spend your life digging coal from the bottom of your grave

Last verse:
      Dm (one strum)
In the deep, dark hills of eastern Kentucky
           Dm (one strum)  
That's the place where I trace my bloodline
         Dm (one strum)
And it’s there I read on a hillside gravestone
       Dm (one strum)
You'll never leave Harlan alive

Black Is The Colour
mardi 23 août 2016
12:13
Capo at 1st Fret (Christy Mack and Hamish Imlach version)




Am               F        G            Am
Black is the colour of my true love's hair.

            F         G      E7               
Her lips are like some roses fair.

                    F             G        E7
She's the sweetest smile and the gentlest hands.

            F      G              Am
I love the ground     where on she stands.


I love my love - well she knows.
I love the ground where on she goes.
I wish the day it soon would come
when she and I could be as one.

I go to the Clyde and mourn and weep
Satisfied I never can be.
I write her a letter, just a few short lines
And suffer death a thousand times.

For black is the colour of my true love's hair.
Her lips are like a rose so fair.
She hast the sweetest smile and the gentlest hands.
I love the ground where on she stands.

The Battle Hymn Of The Republic
lundi 6 février 2017
22:08
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on. 


Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on.


I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;
They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;
I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps,
His day is marching on.


I have read His fiery gospel writ in rows of burnished steel!
"As ye deal with my condemners, so with you My grace shall deal!
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel, "
Since God is marching on.


He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat;
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on.


In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me;
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free!
While God is marching on.

The Regular Army Oh
vendredi 10 février 2017

Set to the melody of "Hot Asphalt", sung by the Dubliners


CAPO III

Verse 1a:

     Am                         C                 G
Three years ago this very day we went to Governors Isle
      Am                  F         G
For to stand against the cannon / in true military style
  Am                            C                 G
Seventeen American dollars each month we'd surely get
    Am                               F           Am
For to carry a gun and a bayonet with regimental step


Verse 1b:

  C
We had a choice of going to the army or to jail
       Am                         G
Oh it's up the Hudson River with a copper take a sail
     F                                C            G
Oh we puckered up our courage and with bravery we did go
     Am                G                  D            Am        
Oh we cursed the day we went away with the Regular Army O


Chorus:

There was Sergeant John McCaffery and Captain Donahue
Oh they made us march and toe the mark in gallant company Q
Well the drums would roll upon me soul this is the style we go
Forty miles a day on beans and hay in the Regular Army O




We be dry as army herrings and as hungry as a Turk
The boys along the street cry out "soldier will you work"
We'd ship into the Navy for to plow the raging seas
But cold water, sure, we couldn't endure. Twould never agree with me

We'd join the politicians and we know we'd be well fed
Oh we sleep no more upon the ground but in a feather bed
And if a war it should break out, they call on us to go
We'll get Italian substitutes in the Regular Army O




Chorus


With cords upon our heels me boys and bunions on our toes
From lugging the gun in the red hot sun with freckles on our nose
England tells us grenediers, France wears its zu zus
The USA never changes they say but always wears the blues

When we are out to pomperade our muskets must be bright
Or they'll slap us in the guardhouse to pass away the night
And when we want a furlough to the colonel we do go
Go to bed and wait till you're dead in the Regular Army O



Chorus x 2

My Son John
jeudi 4 mai 2017
11:30
My son John was tall and slim
And he'd a leg for ev'ry limb
But now he's got no legs at all
For he ran a race with a cannon ball

Timmy roo dun da, fadda riddle da
Whack fo' the riddle Timmy roo dun da

Well were ya drunk or were ya blind
When ya left your two fine legs behind
Or was it sailin' on the sea
Wore your two fine legs right down to the knee

I was not drunk, I was not blind
When I left my two fine legs behind
Nor was it sailin' on the sea
Wore my two fine legs right down to the knee

Each foreign war I'll now denounce
‘tween the King of England and the King of France
For I'd rather my legs as they used to be
Than the king of Spain and his whole navy

I was tall and I was slim
And I'd a leg for ev'ry limb
But now I've got no legs at all
They were both shot away by a cannon ball

I was tall and I was slim
And I'd a leg for ev'ry limb
But now I've got no legs at all
They done come off on a cannon ball

Illinois Central Monday morning rail

Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders

Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.

I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.




[Verse]


Dealing card games with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't noone keeping score
Pass the paper bag but hold the bottle
Feel the wheels rumbling 'neath the floor
  And the sons of Pullman porters and the sons of engineers
  Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel
  Mother with her babes asleep rocking to the gentle beat
  And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel.




[Chorus]


[Verse]


Nightime on the City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis Tennessee
Half way home we'll be there by morning
through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea.
  But all the towns and people seem to fade into a dark dream
  And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
  The conductor sings his songs again, the passagers will please refrain
  This train got the disappearing railroad blues.




[Chorus]


Good night America, How are you?
Say, don't you know me, I'm your native son.
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Alice's Restaurant (Massacree)
dimanche 22 octobre 2017
23:29
This song is called Alice's Restaurant, and it's about Alice, and the restaurant.
But Alice's Restaurant is not the name of the restaurant, that's just the name of the song, and that's why I called the song, Alice's Restaurant.

You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant
You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant
Walk right in it's around the back, just a half a mile from the railroad track
An' you can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant

Now it all started two Thanksgivings ago, was on - two years ago on Thanksgiving, when my friend and I went up to visit Alice at the restaurant, but Alice doesn't live in the restaurant, she lives in the church nearby the restaurant, in the bell-tower, with her husband Ray and Fasha the dog.
And livin' in the bell tower like that, they got a lot of room downstairs where the pews used to be.
An' havin' all that room, seein' as how they took out all the pews, they decided that they didn't have to take out their garbage for a long time.

We got up there, we found all the garbage in there, and we decided it'd be a friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump. So we took the half a ton of garbage, put it in the back of a red VW microbus, took shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the city dump.

Well, we got there and there was a big sign and a chain across across the dump saying, "Closed on Thanksgiving."
And we had never heard of a dump closed on Thanksgiving before, and with tears in our eyes we drove off into the sunset looking for another place to put the garbage.

We didn't find one. Until we came to a side road, and off the side of the side road there was another fifteen foot cliff and at the bottom of the cliff there was another pile of garbage.
And we decided that one big pile is better than two little piles, and rather than bring that one up we decided to throw ours down.

That's what we did, and drove back to the church, had a thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat, went to sleep and didn't get up until the next morning, when we got a phone call from officer Obie.
He said, "Kid, we found your name on an envelope at the bottom of ab' a half a ton of garbage, and just wanted to know if you had any information about it."
And I said, "Yes, sir, Officer Obie, I cannot tell a lie, I put that envelope under that garbage."

After speaking to Obie for about fourty-five minutes on the telephone we finally arrived at the truth of the matter and said, that we had to go down and pick up the garbage, and also had to go down and speak to him at the police officer's station.
So we got in the red VW microbus with the shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the police officer's station.

Now friends, there was only one or two things that Obie coulda done at the police station, and the first was he coulda given us a medal for being so brave and honest on the telephone, which wasn't very likely, and we didn't expect it, and the other thing was he coulda bawled us out and told us never to be see driving garbage around the vicinity again, which is what we expected, but when we got to the police officer's station there was a third possibility that we hadn't even counted upon, and we was both immediately arrested. Handcuffed. And I said "Obie, I don't think I can pick up the garbage with these handcuffs on." He said, "Shut up, kid. Get in the back of the patrol car."

And that's what we did, sat in the back of the patrol car and drove to the quote Scene of the Crime unquote. I want tell you about the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where this happened here, they got three stop signs, two police officers, and one police car, but when we got to the Scene of the Crime there was five police officers and three police cars, being the biggest crime of the last fifty years, and everybody wanted to get in the newspaper story about it. And they was using up all kinds of cop equipment that they had hangin' around the police officer's station. They was taking plaster tire tracks, foot prints, dog smelling prints, and they took twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy photographs with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us. Took pictures of the approach, the getaway, the northwest corner the southwest corner and that's not to mention the aerial photography.

After the ordeal, we went back to the jail. Obie said he was going to put us in the cell. Said, "Kid, I'm going to put you in the cell, I want your wallet and your belt." And I said, "Obie, I can understand you wanting my wallet so I don't have any money to spend in the cell, but what do you want my belt for?" And he said, "Kid, we don't want any hangings." I said, "Obie, did you think I was going to hang myself for litterin'?" Obie said he was making sure, and friends Obie was, cause he took out the toilet seat so I couldn't hit myself over the head and drown, and he took out the toilet paper so I couldn't bend the bars roll out the - roll the toilet paper out the window, slide down the roll and have an escape. Obie was making sure, and it was about four or five hours later that Alice... Remember Alice? It's a song about Alice... Alice came by and with a few nasty words to Obie on the side, bailed us out of jail, and we went back to the church, had a another thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat, and didn't get up until the next morning, when we all had to go to court.

We walked in, sat down, Obie came in with the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one, sat down. Man came in said, "All rise." We all stood up, and Obie stood up with the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures, and the judge walked in sat down with a seeing eye dog, and he sat down, we sat down. Obie looked at the seeing eye dog, and then at the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one, and looked at the seeing eye dog. And then at twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one and began to cry, 'cause Obie came to the realization that it was a typical case of American blind justice, and there wasn't nothing he could do about it, and the judge wasn't going to look at the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us. And we was fined fifty dollars and had to pick up the garbage in the snow, but that's not what I came to tell you about.

Came to talk about the draft.

They got a building down in New York City, it's called Whitehall Street, where you walk in, you get injected, inspected, detected, infected, neglected and selected. I went down to get my physical examination one day, and I walked in, I sat down, got good and drunk the night before, so I looked and felt my best when I went in that morning. 'Cause I wanted to look like the all-American kid from New York City, man I wanted, I wanted to feel like the all-, I wanted to be the all American kid from New York, and I walked in, sat down, I was hung down, brung down, hung up, and all kinds o' mean nasty ugly things. And I waked in and sat down and they gave me a piece of paper, said, "Kid, see the psychiatrist, room 604."

And I went up there, I said, "Shrink, I want to kill. I mean, I wanna, I wanna kill. Kill. I wanna, I wanna see, I wanna see blood and gore and guts and veins in my teeth. Eat dead burnt bodies. I mean kill, kill, kill, kill." And I started jumpin' up and down yelling, "Kill! Kill!" and he started jumpin' up and down with me and we was both jumping up and down yelling, "Kill! Kill!" And the Sargent came over, pinned a medal on me, sent me down the hall, said, "You're our boy."

Didn't feel too good about it.

An' I proceeded on down the hall gettin' more injections, inspections, detections, neglections and all kinds of stuff that they as doin' to me at the thing there, and I was there for two hours, three hours, four hours, I was there for a long time going through all kinds of mean nasty ugly things and I was just having a tough time there, and they was inspecting, injecting every single part of me, and they was leaving no part untouched. Proceeded through, and when I finally came to the see the last man, I walked in, walked in sat down after a whole big thing there, and I walked up and said, "What do you want?" He said, "Kid, we only got one question. Have you ever been arrested?"

And I proceeded to tell him the story of the Alice's Restaurant Massacre, with full orchestration and five part harmony and stuff like that and all the phenome... - and he stopped me right there and said, "Kid, did you ever go to court?"

And I proceeded to tell him the story of the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and the paragraph on the back of each one, and he stopped me right there and said, "Kid, I want you to go and sit down on that bench that says Group W, now kid!"

And I, I walked over to the, to the bench there, and there is, Group W's where they put you if you may not be moral enough to join the army after committin' your special crime, and there was all kinds of mean nasty ugly looking people on the bench there. Mother rapers. Father stabbers. Father rapers! Father rapers sitting right there on the bench next to me! And they was mean and nasty and ugly and horrible crime-type guys sitting on the bench next to me. And the meanest, ugliest, nastiest one, the meanest father raper of them all, was coming over to me and he was mean 'n' ugly 'n' nasty 'n' horrible and all kind of things and he sat down next to me and said, "Kid, whad'ya get?" I said, "I didn't get nothing, I had to pay $50 and pick up the garbage." He said, "What were you arrested for, kid?" And I said, "Litterin'." And they all moved away from me on the bench there, and the hairy eyeball and all kinds of mean nasty things, till I said, "And creating a nuisance." And they all came back, shook my hand, and we had a great time on the bench, talkin' about crime, mother stabbing, father raping, all kinds of groovy things that we was talking about on the bench. And everything was fine, we was smoking cigarettes and all kinds of things, until the Sargent came over, had some paper in his hand, held it up and said.

"Kids, this-piece-of-paper's-got-47-words-37-sentences-58-words-we-wanna-know-details-of-the-crime-time-of-the-crime-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-you-gotta-say-pertaining-to-and-about-the-crime-I-want-to-know-arresting-officer's-name-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-you-gotta-say", and talked for forty-five minutes and nobody understood a word that he said, but we had fun filling out the forms and playing with the pencils on the bench there, and I filled out the massacre with the four part harmony, and wrote it down there, just like it was, and everything was fine and I put down the pencil, and I turned over the piece of paper, and there, there on the other side, in the middle of the other side, away from everything else on the other side, in parentheses, capital letters, quotated, read the following words:

("Kid, have you rehabilitated yourself?")

I went over to the Sargent, said, "Sargent, you got a lot a damn gall to ask me if I've rehabilitated myself, I mean, I mean, I mean that just, I'm sittin' here on the bench, I mean I'm sittin' here on the Group W bench, 'cause you want to know if I'm moral enough join the army, burn women, kids, houses and villages after bein' a litterbug." He looked at me and said, "Kid, we don't like your kind, and we're gonna send you fingerprints off to Washington."

And friends, somewhere in Washington enshrined in some little folder, is a study in black and white of my fingerprints. And the only reason I'm singing you this song now is cause you may know somebody in a similar situation, or you may be in a similar situation, and if your in a situation like that there's only one thing you can do and that's walk into the shrink wherever you are, just walk in say "Shrink, You can get anything you want, at Alice's restaurant." And walk out. You know, if one person, just one person does it they may think he's really sick and they won't take him. And if two people, two people do it, in harmony, they may think they're both faggots and they won't take either of them. And three people do it, three, can you imagine, three people walking in singin' a bar of Alice's Restaurant and walking out. They may think it's an organization. And can you, can you imagine fifty people a day, I said fifty people a day walking in singin' a bar of Alice's Restaurant and walking out. And friends they may thinks it's a movement.

And that's what it is, the Alice's Restaurant Anti-Massacree Movement, and all you got to do to join is sing it the next time it come's around on the guitar.

With feeling. So we'll wait for it to come around on the guitar, here and sing it when it does. Here it comes.

You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant
You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant
Walk right in it's around the back, just a half a mile from the railroad track
You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant

That was horrible. If you want to end war and stuff you got to sing loud. I've been singing this song now for twenty five minutes. I could sing it for another twenty five minutes. I'm not proud... or tired.

So we'll wait till it comes around again, and this time with four part harmony and feeling.

We're just waitin' for it to come around is what we're doing.

All right now.

You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant (Excepting Alice)
You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant
(I said) Walk right in it's around the back, just a half a mile from the railroad track
You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant

Da-da da-da da-da da-dum
At Alice's Restaurant

Am             Am/G       D/F#          F       C - E - E7
Don't touch my bag if you please mister customs man


[Verse 1]
Am             Am/G        D/F#         F
Coming in from London from way over the pole
C                   E - E7
Flying in a big air-liner
Am             Am/G         D/F#      F
Chicken flying everywhere a-round the plane
C                       E - E7
Could we ever feel much finer

Motorcycle Song
lundi 9 janvier 2017
21:01
[G]I don't want a pickle,
Just want to ride on my [C]motors[G]ickle.
[G]And I don't want a tickle,
'Cause I'd rather ride on my [C]motors[G]ickle.
And [C]I don't w[Am]ant to d[G]ie,
Just want to ride on my [C]motorc[G]y--cle.

It was l[G]ate last night the other day,
I thought I'd go up[C] and see R[G]ay.
So I went up and I say Ray--
There was only one thing R[C]ay could say, was:

I don't want a pickle,
Just want to ride on my motorsickle.
And I don't want a tickle,
'Cause I'd rather ride on my motorsickle.
And I don't want to die,
Just want to ride on my motorcy--cle.

Piazza, New York Catcher

4:46 PM
Artists: #Belle & Sebastian 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
              PIAZZA NEW YORK CATCHER - Belle and Sebastian
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Capo II for recorded key.

E                                     A              E
Elope with me Miss Private and we’ll sail around the world
F#m                            C#m
I will be your Ferdinand and you my wayward girl
    F#m                          B
How many nights of talking in hotel rooms can you take?
    F#m                             B
How many nights of limping round on pagan holidays?
     A                               C#m
Oh elope with me in private and we’ll set something ablaze
  F#m            B         C#m
A trail for the devil to erase

E                               A                    E
San Francisco’s calling us, the Giants and Mets will play
F#m                                C#m
Piazza, New York catcher, are you straight or are you gay?
  F#m                            B
We hung about the stadium, we’ve got no place to stay
  F#m                            B
We hung about the tenderloin and tenderly you tell
         A                              C#m
About the saddest book you ever read, it always makes you cry
   F#m              B               C#m
The statue’s crying too and well he may

 E                                A            E
I love you I’ve a drowning grip on your adoring face
 F#m                      C#m
I love you my responsibility has found a place 
 F#m                                  B
Beside you and strong warnings in the guise of gentle words
    F#m                          B
Come wave upon me from the wider family net absurd
            A                                C#m
“You’ll take care of her, I know it, you will do a better job”
F#m         B              C#m
Maybe, but not what she deserves

 E                                  A               E
Elope with me Miss Private and we’ll drink ourselves awake
     F#m                            C#m
We’ll taste the coffee houses and award certificates
 F#m                             B
A privy seal to keep the feel of 1960 style
     F#m                             B
We’ll comment on the decor and we’ll help the passer by
      A                               C#m
And at dusk when work is over we’ll continue the debate
    F#m               B             C#m
In a borrowed bedroom virginal and spare

   E                         A             E
The catcher hits for .318 and catches every day
   F#m                              C#m
The pitcher puts religion first and rests on holidays
  F#m                            B
He goes into cathedrals and lies prostrate on the floor
  F#m                                     B
He knows the drink affects his speed he’s praying for 
F# doorway 
      A                                C#m
Back into the life he wants and the confession of the bench
F#m               B            C#m
Life outside the diamond is a wrench

 E                                  A             E
I wish that you were here with me to pass the dull weekend
 F#m                                C#m
I know it wouldn’t come to love, my heroine pretend
 F#m                              B
A lady stepping from the songs we love until this day
     F#m                          B
You’d settle for an epitaph like “Walk Away, Renee”
         A                               C#m
The sun upon the roof in winter will draw you out like 
F# flower

F#m              B            C#m
Meet you at the statue in an hour
F#m              B            C#m
Meet you at the statue in an hour

Step Into My Office, Baby
jeudi 18 août 2016

D6 : x-x-0-2-0-2
INTRO : E - E - A - A - G - D/F# - E - E
VERSE :
E             A
She called me up today
G       D/F#        E
Meet me down at the old café
E          A
I jumped into the shower
G     D/F#       E
I was getting my marching orders
CHORUS :
D          Dsus4
We need to talk
D          Dsus4 - D - G - D/F#
Step into my office, baby
D                      F
I wanna give you the job
 C             F
A chance of overtime
    B           E
Say, my place at nine?
(verse chords)
She'd never stand for any lies
She's got an Out Tray full of guys
I could sense a breath, a whole new feeling
Now she says she wants to call a meeting
(play chorus)
BRIDGE :
     Am       D
I'm a slave to work
        G             B7               Em     A
I'm only living when I walk amongst the office staff
            D              B7
And catch up with the office wag
          E      A
I'll be in bed by nine
  B        A
My curtains drawn
              E
My thoughts composed
 A              B
I get to work on time
(verse chords)
She gave me some dictation
But my strength is in administration
I took down all she said
I even took down her little red dress
(chorus chords)
We need to talk
Step into my office, baby
I wanna give you the job
I'm pushing for a raise
Been pushing now for days
BRIDGE 2 :
E               A
My output is in decline
A                G     C   A
I was burned out after Thatcher
E                D6
My banner I laid down with a sigh
A                   G    C     A
Now I doubt if I'll ever catch her
(E7)
(verse chords)
I've got to change my ways
Dress for business every day
A smart suit and a kipper tie
A big arrow pointing to my fly
(chorus chords)
We need to talk
Step into my office, baby
I wanna give you the job
A chance of overtime
Say, my place at nine?

I Fought In A War
samedi 4 février 2017
19:53
in the first part of the song you just strike the chords once
1st Verse:
Em                          A
  I fought in a war and I left my friends behind me
C                             B   
To go looking for the enemy, and it wasnt very long
Em                           A  
  Before I would stand with another boy in front of me
                                               
      C                                      B
And a corpse that just fell into me, with the bullets flying round...
1st chorus:
G                                Am
And I reminded myself of the words you said when we were getting on
C                                        B
And I bet youre making shells back home for a steady boy to wear
G                                   Am
Round his neck, well it wont hurt to think of you as if youre waiting for
C                           B
This letter to arrive because Ill be here quite a while
In the second 
down,down,up,up,down,up
2nd verse:
Em                          A
  I fought in a war and I left my friends behind me
C                             B  
To go looking for the enemy, and it wasnt very long
Em                              A       
  Before I found out that the sickness there ahead of me
C                              B         
Went beyond the bedsit infamy of the decade gone before
2nd chorus:     
G                               Am      
And I reminded myself of the words you said when we were getting on
C                                        B        
And I bet youre making shells back home for a steady man to wear
G                                  Am
Round his neck, well it wont hurt to think of you as if youre waiting for
C                            B            
This letter to arrive because Ill be here quite a while

|-----------------|

twice for each chord



3rd Verse:
Em                           A  
  I fought in a war, and I didnt know where it would end
C                               B
It stretched before me infinitely, I couldnt really think
Em                                  A   
  Of the day beyond now, keep your head down pal
C
Theres trouble plenty in this hour, this day
B
I can see hope I can see light
3rd Chorus
G                               Am                              
And I reminded myself of the looks you gave when we were getting on
C                                        B
And I bet youre making shells back home for a steady man to wear
G                                  Am        
Round his neck, well it wont hurt to think of you as if youre waiting for
C                            B
This letter to arrive because Ill be here quite a while

Sleep The Clock Around
samedi 4 février 2017
19:56
Intro
E B C#m A
E
And the moment will come when composure returns
     B
Put a face on the world, turn your back to the wall
       C#m
And you walk twenty yards with your head in the air
        A
Down the Liberty Hill, where the fashion brigade
         E
Look with curious eyes on your raggedy way
       B
And for once in your life you've got nothing to say
         C#m
And could this be the time when somebody will come
        A
To say, "Look at yourself, you're not much use to anyone"

E B C#m A

Take a walk in the park, take a valium pill
Read the letter you got from the memory girl
But it takes more than this to make sense of the day
Yeah, it takes more than milk to get rid of the taste
And you trusted to this, and you trusted to that
And when you saw it all come, it was waving the flag
Of the United States of Calamity, hey!
After all that you've done, boy, I know you're going to pay

E B C#m A x2


In the morning you come to the ladies salon
To get all fitted out for The Paperback Throne
But the people are living far away from the place
Where you wanted to help, it's a bit of a waste
And the puzzle will last until somebody will say
"There's a lot to be done while your head is still young"      
If you put down your pen, leave your worries behind         
Then the moment will come, and the memory will shine

Intrumental
E B C#m A 

Now the trouble is over, everybody got paid
Everybody is happy, they are glad that they came       
Then you go to the place where you've finally found
You can look at yourself, sleep the clock around 

Outro

E B C#m A

Is It Wicked Not To Care?

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

     G#                           C#                 G#
Is it wicked not to care when they say that you're mistaken
        C#                G#                 D#
Thinking hopes and lots of dreams that aren't there? 
     G#                             C#          G#
Is it wicked not to care when you've wasted many hours 
       C#           G#            D#
Talking endlessly to anyone that's there?
A#m
I know the truth awaits me
                               D#
But still I hesitate because of fear
G#                             C#             G#              
Skipping tickets making rhymes, is that all that you believe in?
       C#               G#        D#
Wearing rags to make you pretty by design
       G#                          C#               G# 
Rusting armour for effect, it's not fun to watch the rust grow
   C#             G#               D#
For it will all be over when you're dead
A#m A#m D# x2
G#                                  C#              G#
Counting acts and clutching thoughts, by the river where the moss grows 
    C#              G#              D#
Over rocks the water running all the time
     G#                          C#                   G#
Is it wicked when you smile, even though you feel like crying
    C#                  G#          D#
Even though you could be sick at any time?
A#m
But if there was a sequel
A#m
Would you love me as an equal?
A#m                          D#
Would you love me until I'm dead?
G# C# G# C# G# D# x2 (the verse chords)
A#m
If there was a sequel 
A#m
Would you love me like an equal? 
A#m                         D#
Would you love me until I'm dead?
A#m
If there was a sequel 
A#m
Would you love me like an equal? 
A#m                         D#

[Intro]
G
[Verse 1]
G
A mile and a half on a bus takes a long time, The odour of old prison food 
                    C 
takes a long time to pass you by
G
Day upon day of this wandering gets you down, nobody gives you a chance or a 
         C
dollar in this old town
G
Hovering silence from you is a giveaway, squalor and smoke's not your style
                        C
I don't like this place, We better go
G                                                                            
Then I compare notes with your older sister, I am a lazy get, she is as pure 
      C
as the cold driven snow
D
G
[Verse 2]
G
What did you learn from your time in the solitary cell of your mind?
                                   C
There was noises, distractions from anything good and the old prison food
G
Colour my life with the chaos of trouble
G
Cause anything's better than posh isolation, I missed the bus, You were laid
on your back
                          D
With the boy with the arab strap
                          G
With the boy from the arab strap
G C
G C
D C G
[Verse 3]
G
It's something to speak of the way you are feeling to crowds there assembled
                         C
Do you ever feel you have gone too far?
G
Everyone suffers in silence a burden, the man who drives minicabs down in Old Compton
   C                                                   D
The Asian man With his love/hate affair with his racist clientele
 G
A central location for you is a must as you stagger about making free with 
             C
your lewd and lascivious boasts
  G
We all know you are soft because we've all seen you dancing
                                                         C
We know you are hard because we all saw you drinking from noon until noon again
                              D
You're the boy with the filthy laugh
                            G
You're the boy with the arab strap
G C
G C
[Verse 4]
G
Strapped to the table with suits from the shelter shop
                                        C  
Comic celebrity takes a back seat as the cigarette catches and sets off the smoke alarm
G
What do you make of the cool set in London?
                                                  C
You're constantly updating your hit parade of your ten biggest wanks
                              D
She's a waitress and she's got style
                                  G
Sunday bathtime could take a while

Of all the trouble kept her inside
(Repeat with the rest of the song)
Take Judy, with her bow and arrow, she's a mastermind
Too frumpy for the teenage population of her time
Car coat, she has a quilted jacket with a hood if it rains
Big pockets for the pharmaceuticals she takes to fix her brain
The rollercoaster ride
The rollercoaster ride
Of all the trouble kept her inside
Of all the trouble kept her inside
A puzzle, for the moment settle down to do it with him
You're happy cause your cosy and the rain comes rattling in
It tickles, and it's something that is very good for the skin
You're waiting for a baby, Baby, watch the idiot running
Refrain
You're hanging from the balcony upon the riverboat glass 
You're watching with your mouth wide open for the top of the
class
She came on with the boys while you were stuck in various poses 
If you were to remove your clothes d'you think the singer would
notice?

Capo II

   G                   D/f#          G     [lick 1]
I'm out here a thousand miles from my home
C         G/b        D/a           G        [lick 1]
Walking a road other men have gone down
   G           /DhE     C          G       [lick 1]
I'm seeing your world of people and things
    G [lick 2]  /b           (D/a)       G [lick 1]
Hear paupers and peasants and princes and kings.

Hey hey Woody Guthrie I wrote you a song
About a funny old world that's coming along
Seems sick and it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn
It looks like it's dying and it's hardly been born.

Hey Woody Guthrie but I know that you know
All the things that I'm saying and a many times more
I'm singing you this song but I can't sing enough
'Cause there's not many men that've done the things that you've done.

Here's to Cisco and Sonny and Leadbelly too
And to all the good people that travelled with you
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind.

I'm leaving tomorrow but I could leave today
Somewhere down the road someday
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Is to say I've been hitting some hard travelling too.

The Gates Of Eden
Friday, November 14, 2014

Artists: #Bob Dylan 

   D                C

Of war and peace the truth just twists
   G              D         G    D
Its curfew gull it glides
   D                C
Upon four-legged forest clouds
    G             D         G    D
The cowboy angel rides
        D            A7   D
With his candle lit into the sun
          G     C        G   A
Though its glow is waxed in black
D                F       G       D       G  D
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden

The lamppost stands with folded arms
Its iron claws attached
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail
Though it shadows metal badge
All and all can only fall
With a crashing but meaningless blow
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden

The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf
But still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
At ships with tattooed sails
Heading for the Gates of Eden

With a time-rusted compass blade
Aladdin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks
Side saddle on the Golden Calf
And on their promises of paradise
You will not hear a laugh
All except inside the Gates of Eden

Relationships of ownership
They whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly
And wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs
The lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden

The motorcycle black madonna
Two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom cause
The gray flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden

The kingdoms of Experience
In the precious wind they rot
While paupers change possessions
Each one wishing for what the other has got
And the princess and the prince
Discuss what's real and what is not
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden

The foreign sun, it squints upon
A bed that is never mine
As friends and other strangers
From their fates try to resign
Leaving men wholly, totally free
To do anything they wish to do but die
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden

At dawn my lover comes to me
And tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words
But these to tell what's true
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

Ballad of Donald White
Friday, November 14, 2014
5:16 PM
Artists: #Bob Dylan 

C                 F
My name is Donald White, you see,
 G7               C
I stand before you all.
     C               F     C
I was judged by you a murderer
                           G7
And the hangman's knot must fall.
      C            F       C
I will die upon the gallows pole
                        F
When the moon is shining clear,
   C            F
And these are my final words
    G7            C
That you will ever hear.

I left my home in Kansas
When I was very young,
I landed in the old Northwest,
Seattle, Washington
Although I'd a-traveled many miles,
I never made a friend,
For I could never get along in life
With people that I met.

If I had some education
To give me a decent start,
I might have been a doctor or
A master in the arts.
But I used my hands for stealing
When I was very young,
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,
That's how my life begun.

Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,
I found they were my kind,
And it was there inside the bars
I found my peace of mind.
But the jails they were too crowded,
Institutions overflowed,
So they turned me loose to walk upon
Life's hurried tangled road.

And there's danger on the ocean
Where the salt sea waves split high,
And there's danger on the battlefield
Where the shells of bullets fly,
And there's danger in this open world
Where men strive to be free,
And for me the greatest danger
Was in society.

So I asked them to send me back
To the institution home.
But they said they were too crowded,
For me they had no room.
I got down on my knees and begged,
"Oh, please put me away,"
But they would not listen to my plea
Or nothing I would say.

And so it was on Christmas eve
In the year of '59,
It was on that night I killed a man,
I did not try to hide,
The jury found me guilty
And I won't disagree,
For I knew that it would happen
If I wasn't put away.

And I'm glad I've had no parents
To care for me or cry,
For now they will never know
The horrible death I die.
And I'm also glad I've had no friends
To see me in disgrace,
For they'll never see that hangman's hood
Wrap around my face.

Farewell unto the old north woods
Of which I used to roam,
Farewell unto the crowded bars
Of which've been my home,
Farewell to all you people
Who think the worst of me,
I guess you'll feel much better when
I'm on that hanging tree.

But there's just one question
Before they kill me dead,
I'm wondering just how much
To you I really said
Concerning all the boys that come
Down a road like me,
Are they enemies or victims
Of your society?

Don't Think Twice, It's Alright

Capo IV


Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
Even you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow


When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window, and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on
But don't think twice, it's all right.


And It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road


But I wish there was somethin' you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we never did too much talking anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right.


So It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can't hear you any more


I'm a-thinking and a-wonderin' walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I am told
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right.


So long honey, baby
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I'll just say fare thee well


I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right.

Oh I'm sailin' away my own true love
I'm sailin' away in the morning
Is there something I can send you from across the sea
From the place that I'll be landing ?


No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love
There's nothin' I wish to be ownin'
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean.


Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona ?


Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'.


That I might be gone a long time
And it's only that I'm askin'
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passin' ?


Oh, how can, how can you ask me again
It only brings me sorrow
The same thing I want from you today
I would want again tomorrow.


I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailin'
Saying I don't know when I'll be comin' back again
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'.


Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way
I'm sure your mind is roarmin'
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country to where you're goin'.


So take heed, take heed of the western wind
Take heed of the stormy weather
And yes, there's something you can send back to me
Spanish boots of Spanish leather.

All the way from New Orleans

  To Jerusalem


I traveled through east Texas
Where many martyrs fell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell


Well I heard that hoot owl singing
As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Were his only audience


Them charcoal gypsie maidens
Can strut their feathers well
But nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell


See them big plantations burning
Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
See the ghosts of slavery ships


I can hear them tribes a-moaning
Hear the undertaker's bell
Nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell


There's a woman by the river
With some fine young handsome man
He's dressed up like a squire
Bootlegged whisky in his hand


There's a chain gang on the highway
I can hear them rebels yell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

In 3/4 

C
Ramona, come closer
                       G    G6  G7
Shut softly your watery eyes

The pangs of your sadness
                             C    Csus4   C
Will pass as your senses will rise
   F
The flowers of the city
                                   G      G6   G7
Though breathlike, get deathlike sometimes

And there's no use in tryin'

To deal with the dyin'
                               C
Though I cannot explain that in lines.

Your cracked country lips
I still wish to kiss
As to be by the strength of you skin
Your magnetic movements
Still capture the minutes I'm in
But it grieves my heart, love
To see you tryin' to be a part of
A world that just don't exist.
It's all just a dream, babe
A vacuum, a scheme, babe
That sucks you into feelin' like this.

I can see that your head
Has been twisted and fed
With worthless foam from the mouth
I can tell you are torn
Between stayin' and returnin'
Back to the South
You've been fooled into thinking
That the finishin' end is at hand
Yet there's no one to beat you
No one to defeat you
'Cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad

I've heard you say many times
That you're better than no one
And no one is better than you
If you really believe that
You know you have
Nothing to win and nothing to lose
From fixtures and forces and friends
Your sorrow does stem
That hype you and type you
Making you feel
That you gotta be just like them.

It's All Over Now, Baby Blue
Bob Dylan

Transcription (and any mistakes) by jwblair@ix.netcom.com

I figured this out a few years back when I bought the video
"Don't Look Back". You see Dylan detune and some fingerings
when he plays "Baby Blue" for Donovan in the hotel. (By the
way, in "Don't Look Back" Dylan capos 2, but Donovan's guitar
is tuned 1/2 tone below concert, so capo 1 to play along
with the video.)

Bringing It All Back Home version
Capo 4, top E tuned down to C

Note-> CADGBe
       ++++++
C:     032010
Csus4: 033010 (add the little finger on the 4th string)
G:     220000 (actually an Em7, but this is what he plays for G)
F:     003211
Dm:    200231 (use the thumb to fret the 6th string)
E:     x22100 (or maybe E7: x22130)

(Note: be sure to strum the 6th string to keep the distinctive
droning C note going.)

Intro: C and Csus4
      (hammering onto the 4th string at the 2nd fret)



G                                           F          C
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
       G                                 F       C
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Dm                 F               C
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Dm            F           C
Crying like a fire in the sun
E7
                 F      G
Look out the saints are coming through
   Dm            F         C
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.


The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.
This sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.


All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home.
Your empty handed armies, they're all going home.
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor.
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.


Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you.
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you.
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.

ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER                (Bob Dylan)

            Am                G                F           G   Am  
           (play it forever)
               There must be some kind of way out of here

               Said the joker to the thief

               There's too much confusion

               I can't get no relief

               Buisness men they drink my wine

               Plowmen dig my earth

               None would ever compromise

               Nobody of this world

               No reason to get excited

               The thief he kindly spoke

               There are many here among us

               Who feel that life is but a joke

               But you and I we've been through that

               And this is not our place

               So let us stop talking falsely now

               The hour's getting late

               All along the watchtower

               Princess kept the view

               While all the women came and went

               Barefoot servants too

              Outside in the cold distance

               A wildcat did growl

               Two riders were approaching

               And the wind began to howl

               All along the watchtower

               All along the watchtower

               All along the watchtower

Only A Pawn In Their Game
Words and music Bob Dylan
Released on The Times They Are A-Changin' (1964)
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem
Capo 2nd fret (sounding key A major)
The figure C /b /a G which at every transition from C to G through the whole song, is played:

 C/b/a   G
 .       |
|-0-----|-3--
|-1-----|-0--
|-0-----|-0--
|-2-0-0-|-0--
|-3-2-0-|-2--

Verses 3-5 are played as the second verse, with the Bm' chord x04430 in the first line


 G               C   /b /a G         C      /b /a  G
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers' blood.
  G                C          /b  D/a
A finger fired the trigger to his name.
/c /b G          C   /b /a  G
A     handle hid out in the dark
  C            G
A hand set the spark
    C             G
Two eyes took the aim
  C            G
Behind a man's brain
    C           G
But he can't be blamed
     G /b C D    C  /b    G
He's only a pawn in their game.

  G         Bm'    Am              C          G
A South politician preaches to the poor white man,
         G             C       /b       D
"You got more than the blacks, don't complain.
/c /b  G           C              /b        /a    G      C      G
You're better than them, you been born with white skin," they explain.
And the Negro's name
Is used it is plain
For the politician's gain
As he rises to fame
And the poor white remains
On the caboose of the train
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game.

The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid,
And the marshals and cops get the same,
But the poor white man's used in the hands of them all like a tool.
He's taught in his school
From the start by the rule
That the laws are with him
To protect his white skin
To keep up his hate
So he never thinks straight
'Bout the shape that he's in
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game.

From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks,
And the hoof beats pound in his brain.
And he's taught how to walk in a pack
Shoot in the back
With his fist in a clinch
To hang and to lynch
To hide 'neath the hood
To kill with no pain
Like a dog on a chain
He ain't got no name
But it ain't him to blame
He's only a pawn in their game.

Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught.
They lowered him down as a king.
/c /b        G       C   G           C
But when the shadowy sun sets on the one
That fired the gun
He'll see by his grave
On the stone that remains
Carved next to his name
His epitaph plain:
Only a pawn in their game.

The fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls they'll be smiling.
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand,
The hour that the ship comes in.
And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Em C G
Will not be understood as they're spoken.
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
G /b C /b D /c /b-a G
And be buried at the bottom of the o - cean.

A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline.
And the sun will respect
The every face on the deck,
The hour that the ship comes in.
Then the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
        Em    C            G
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'.
And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again
        G      /b  C     /b D  /c /b-a G
That the whole wide world is wa    -    tchin'.

Oh the foes will rise
With the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'.
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And they'll know that it's for real,
The hour that the ship comes in.
Then they'll raise their hands,
Sayin' we'll meet all your demands,
But we'll shout from the bow your days are numbered.
And like Pharaoh's tribe,
They'll be drownded in the tide,
And like Goliath, they'll be conquered.


The Bootleg Series 1-3 Version
Played on the piano, in basically the same way as the guitar version. I had to tune the guitar up a little bit; he may have played it in Ab major, since he likes the black keys on the piano.

The Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carroll
jeudi 27 octobre 2016
17:03

Words and music Bob Dylan
Released on The Times They Are A-Changin' (1964) and on Biograph (1985) and in live versions on Live 1975 (2002) and Live 1964 (2004)
Tabbed by Eyolf Østrem

Capo 4th fret (sounding key E major). Live 1975: no capo
In most live renditions, he ends each phrase of the verse with a G chord.
The place marked with *) is often embellished with the following figure:

 G   G6  G7
|-------------|
|-------------|
|-------------|
|-0---2---3---|
|-2-----------|
|-3-----------|

C          Am            Em
William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
      C            Am                 Em
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
    C         Am      Em
At a Baltimore hotel society gath'rin'.
       C                Am         Em
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
       C           Am      Em
As they rode him in custody down to the station
          C          Am         Em                    G
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder.
   F   G *)   C            Am        F    G  *)    C
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
F        G *) C             Am
Take the rag away from your face.
F             G *)          C
Now ain't the time for your tears.


William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland,
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was a-snarling,
And in a matter of minutes on bail was out walking.
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears,
Take the rag away from your face.
Now ain't the time for your tears.


Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen.
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn't even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level,
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room,
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle.
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger.
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Take the rag away from your face.
Now ain't the time for your tears.


In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all's equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books ain't pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught 'em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom,
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'.
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished,
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance,
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence.
Oh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears,
Bury the rag deep in your face
For now's the time for your tears.

Visions Of Johanna
dimanche 30 octobre 2016
13:05
Below is the album version. The Live 1966 version is identical, save for the G/b in the last line, which is played as a straight G. (In live versions from the never ending tour, this chord is played as a G6 chord: 320000)
Capo 2nd fret (sounding key A major)

G   C/g G

G
Ain't it just like the night
       C                  D               G      C/g G
to play tricks when you're tryin' to be so quiet?
  G
We sit here stranded,
            C             D         G
though we're all doin' our best to deny it
   D
And Louise holds a handful of rain,
                 G         C/g G
temptin' you to defy it
      C                         G
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
  C                             G
In this room the heat pipes just cough
   C                           G
The country music station plays soft
                                           D
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
       G           C     D    G
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
         C          G/b          D          G
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind


<harmonica>

In the empty lot where the ladies play
blindman's bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls
they whisper of escapades out on the "D" train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's really insane
Louise, she's all right, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror                    1)
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna
have now taken my place

<harmonica>

Now, little boy lost,
he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery,
he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me                          2)
He's sure got a lotta gall
to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall
while I'm in the hall
How can I explain?
Oh, it's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna,
they kept me up past the dawn


<harmonica>


Inside the museums,
Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what
salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeeze
I can't find my knees"
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna,
they make it all seem so cruel

<harmonica>


The peddler now speaks                                      3)
to the countess who's pretending to care for him
Sayin', "Name me someone that's not a parasite
and I'll go out and say a prayer for him"
But like Louise always says
"Ya can't look at much, can ya man?"
As she, herself, prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes ev'rything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes (D)
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna
are now all that remain

Ballad Of A Thin Man
dimanche 30 octobre 2016
13:06
Piano song, original key B minor. Here's a guitar version in Am, which is what he usually plays these days. The Dm can be played x03230, which makes the transition between Am and Dm quite smooth. I'm quite certain I've heard him play that himself, just can't remember where/when.
The chords of the initial descending bass line can be played with a sustained Am and a descending bass, or as in the more elaborate Budokan version (see below).
In the second verse (at least) there is a “d” sounding in the F of the last line, which would make it an F6 or a Dm/f.
The intro then goes like this:


       Am           Dm  Am

Album Version


Capo 2nd fret

Am
You walk into the room
/g#
With your pencil in your hand
/g
You see somebody naked
      /f#
And you say, "Who is that man?"
F
You try so hard
       Dm
But you don't understand
C                  Em
Just what you will say
            Am
When you get home
 C                  Em
Because something is happening here
       Am
But you don't know what it is
F              Am
Do you, Mister Jones?



You raise up your head *)
And you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And somebody points to you and says
"It's his"
And you say, "What's mine?"
And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
And you say, "Oh my God
Am I here all alone?"
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says, "How does it feel
To be such a freak?"
And you say, "Impossible"
As he hands you a bone
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?


Am
You have many contacts
C
Among the lumberjacks
  F
To get you facts
                              Am
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
C
Anyway they already expect you
  F
To just give a check
  Dm                           G         (/g#)
To tax-deductible charity organizations


You've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers **) you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You're very well read
It's well known
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels ***)
And he says, "Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan"
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word "NOW"
And you say, "For what reason?"
And he says, "How?"
And you say, "What does this mean?"
And he screams back, "You're a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home"
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is ****)
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones *****)
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

G/b
Darkness at the break of noon
D
Shadows even the silver spoon
   Csus2
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
G/b
Eclipses both the sun and moon
  Bb6
To understand you know too soon
                    D
There is no sense in trying.

Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece
The hollow horn plays wasted words
Proves to warn
That he not busy being born
Is busy dying.

Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover
That you'd just be
One more person crying.

D           A
So don't fear if you hear
 D                     G/b
A foreign sound to your ear
D    A  G/b   A            D
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing.

As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred.

Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Made everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far
That not much
Is really sacred.

While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the president of the United States
Sometimes must have
To stand naked.

An' though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it.

Advertising signs that con you
Into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime life outside goes on
All around you.

You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks
They really found you.

A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy
Insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not fergit
That it is not he or she or them or it
That you belong to.

Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to.

For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Cultivate their flowers to be
Nothing more than something
They invest in.

While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And then say God bless him.

While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That he's in.

But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him.

Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares Propaganda, all is phony.

While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely.

My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
False gods, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say okay, I have had enough
What else can you show me?

And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only.

Dropped D tuning (DAdgbe')
Chords:
Cadd2   030030
Dm/f    003230 or 003030

Occasionally the G/b chord is inserted in the return from Cadd2 to Dm. 
At *) a Cadd2 is inserted in some of the verses.

Dm
Come you masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
        Cadd2         Dm
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
        *)
You that hide behind desks
                  Cadd2
I just want you to know
                      Dm
I can see through your masks
You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain
You fasten the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud
You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
                   Dm/f
You ain't worth the blood
    Cadd2        Dm
That runs in your veins
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
                Cadd2
Even Jesus would never
  G/b           Dm
Forgive what you do
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul
And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
                        Dm/f
And I'll stand o'er your grave
        Cadd2            Dm
'Til I'm sure that you're dead

        E-A-D-G-B-e
Gmaj7/D  x-x-0-0-0-2
[Verse 1]
G             Em         C        G
Come gather 'round people wherever you roam
     G            Am      C              D
And admit that the waters around you have grown
     G            Em             C               G
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
       G       Am           D
If your time to you is worth savin'
        D            D7                 Gmaj7/D     D
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone,
       G                 C    D  G
For the times, they are a chang - in'
[Verse 2]
G           Em                C              G
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
   G              Am              C           D
And keep your eyes wide the chance won't come again
   G               Em           C                G
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
           G          Am            D
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
       D     D7          Gmaj7/D  D
For the loser now will be later to win
       G                 C    D  G
For the times they are a-changin'
[Verse 3]
G         Em          C               G
Come senators, congressmen please heed the call
     G            Am             C            D
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
   G            Em           C          G
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
         G         Am            D
There's a battle outside and it's ragin'
     D               D7          Gmaj7/D     D
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
       G                 C    D  G
For the times they are a-changin'
[Verse 4]
G           Em      C              G
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
   G          Am            C          D
And don't criticize what you can't understand
    G             Em              C            G
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
    G           Am      D
Your old road is rapidly agin'
          D          D7             Gmaj7/D      D
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend a hand
       G                 C    D  G
For the times they are a-changin'
[Verse 5]
G          Em        C           G
The line it is drawn the curse it is cast
   G        Am       C        D
The slow one now will later be fast
      G       Em       C        G
As the present now will later be past
   G        Am      D
The order is rapidly fadin'
       D         D7       Gmaj7/D  D
And the first one now will later be last
       G                 C    D  G
For the times they are a-changin'

Esus : c'est un Em sur les cordes III et IV au lieu de IV et V

Intro: Em  (Em Esus)

    Em                        D               C   - G/B   -         Em
The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst, out at you from their hiding place
     Em                D                  C   -  G/B  -  Em
Like acid and oil on a madman's face, his reason tends to fly away
     C                   G                C                 B
Like lesser birds on the four winds, like silver scrapes in May
Em               D                 C   -  G/B    -      Em     (Em Esus)
Now the sands become a crust, and most of you have gone away

     Em               D            C    -   G/B  - Em
Come Susy dear, let's take a walk, just out there upon the beach
  Em                  D                C   -  G/B    -        Em
I know you'll soon be married, and you want to know where the winds come from

          C            G            C               B
Well it's never said at all, on the map that Carrie reads
  Em                   D             C   -  G/B   -    Em  (Em Esus)
Behind the clock back there you know, at the Four Winds Bar

Solo: (Em-D C) x4  D 

Em-C D-Em  Em-C D-Em  Em      -          C
Hey, hey,  hey, hey,  four winds at the Four Winds Bar
D          -          Em             Em         -     C
Two doors locked and windows barred, one door let to take you in
    D        -     Em
The other one just mirrors it

Em-C D-Em  Em-C D-Em     Em     -          C
Hey, hey,  hey, hey, in hellish glare and inference,
   D       -      Em             Em       -     C
The other one's a duplicate, the queenly flux, eternal light
D          -       Em                   Em      -  C    D    -  Em
Or the light that never warms, yes the light that never, never warms
       Em    -    C      D-C - D      D-C - D      D-C - D    Em
Or the light that never, never warms, never warms, never warms

    Em                        D               C  -  G/B    -       Em
The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst, out at you from their hiding place
     Em               D                C   -   G/B    -   Em
Miss Carrie Nurse and Suzy Dear, would find themselves at Four Winds Bar
         C             G          C          B
It's the nexus of the crisis, the origin of storms
Em                D             C    - G/B   -   Em          (Em Esus)
Just the place to hopelessly, encounter time and then came me

Solo: (Em-D C) x4  D 

Em-C D-Em  Em-C D-Em  Em-C D-Em  Em-C D-Em
Hey, hey, hey, hey,   Hey, hey, hey, hey

Em     -     C     D    -   Em            Em       -        C
Call me Desdinova, eternal light, these gravely digs of mine
     D     -        Em         Em      -       C    D        -        Em
Will surely prove a sight, and don't forget my dog, fixed and consequent

Solo: Em

They looked backward and said goodby...she had become like they are

She had taken his hand...she had become like they are

Early in the evenin, just around supper time, over by the courthouse, 
       G               C    F                        C 
they're starting to unwind, four kids on the corner, trying to bring you

                               G              C         
And Willy goes into a dance and doubles on Kazoo.

come from all around to watch the magic boy.

When it's over, so they say

Been that way for all my time

'Til forever on it goes

Thru the circle fast and slow, I know

When I go by Baltimore
Ain't no carpet on my floor
Come along and follow me
We'll go down to Galilee
Green, green rocky road 
Promenade in green
Tell me who ya love
Tell me who ya love
See that crow up in the sky
He don't walk, he just fly
He don't walk, and he don't run
Keeps on flappin' to the sun
Green, green rocky road
Promenade in green
Tell me who ya love
Tell me who ya love
Little Miss Jane runnin' to the wall
Don't you stumble, don't you fall
Don't you sing, and don't you shout
When I sing come runnin' out
Hollerin' green, green rocky road
Promenade in green
Tell me who ya love
Tell me who ya love
Ooka, Dooka, soda cracker
Does your mamma chew tobacka?
If your mama chews tobacka
Ooka, Dooka, Ooka, Dooka, soda cracker
Hollerin' green, green rocky road
Promenade in green
Tell me who ya love
Tell me who ya love
When I go by Baltimore
Need no carpet on my floor
Come along and follow me
There's a man in Galilee
Hollerin' green, green rocky road
Promenade in green
Tell me who ya love
Tell me who ya love

Luang Prabang

   B                   
When I came back from Luang Prabang 
  A                            B
I didn't have a thing where my balls used to hang, 
      B
But I got a wood medal and a fine harangue. 
A                  B
Now I'm a fucking hero. 
Mourn your dead land of the free! 
If you want to be a hero follow me. 
Mourn your dead land of the free! 
If you want to be a hero follow me. 
And now the boys all envy me: 
I fought for Christian Democracy 
With nothing but air where my balls used to be. 
Now I'm a fucking hero 
Mourn your dead land of the free! 
If you want to be a hero follow me. 
Mourn your dead land of the free! 
If you want to be a hero follow me. 
When one and twenty cannon thunder 
Into the bloody wild blue yonder 
For a patriotic ball-less wonder. 
Now I'm a fucking hero. 
Mourn your dead land of the free! 
If you want to be a hero follow me. 
Mourn your dead land of the free! 
If you want to be a hero follow me. 
In Luang Prabang there is a spot 
Where the corpses of your brothers rot, 
And every corpse is a patriot, 
And every corpse is a hero. 
Mourn your dead land of the free! 
If you want to be a hero follow me. 
Mourn your dead land of the free! 
If you want to be a hero follow me.

Dink's Song
samedi 4 février 2017

Fare The Well (Dink's Song) from Joel & Ethan Coen's film Inside Llewyn Davis
Capo on 2
[Verse 1]
C              F            C
If I had Wings, like Noah's Dove
               Am            G     F
I'd fly up the river, to the one I love
C               F  C      G         C
Fare the  well, my honey, fare thee well.
[Verse 2]
C           F      C
Well I had a man, who was long and tall
          Am            G     F
Moved his body like a cannonball
         C     F  C      G         C
Fare the well, my honey, Fare thee well
[Verse 3]
C           F      C
I remember one evening, in the pouring rain
          Am            G     F
In my heart was an aching pain
         C     F  C      G         C
Fare the well, my honey, fare thee well.
[Verse 4]
C           F      C
Muddy river is muddy and wild
          Am            G     F
Can't give a bloody for my unborn child
         C     F  C      G         C
Fare the well, my honey, fare the well.
[Verse 5]
C           F      C
Show us a bird, flying high above
          Am            G     F
Life ain't worth living without the one you love
         C     F  C      G         C
Fare the well, my honey, fare thee well.
         C     F  C      G         C
Fare the well, my honey, fare thee well

[Intro]

G D Cadd9 G/BduqqqwsqwwdwfHkrdzs w G/A  
G D Cadd9 G/B G/A  

last one do the "oh yeah, ah!" along as the song does


[Verse 1]

G
Now Ziggy played guitar,
Bm                            C
 Jamming good with Weird and Gilly,
          B    C    D
And the Spiders from Mars.
                      G
He played it left hand,
                   Em
But made it too far.
              A
Became the special man,
            C
Then we were Ziggy's band.


[Verse 2]

G
Ziggy really sang,
Bm                               C
screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo,
             B    C D
like some cat from Japan.
                         G
He could lick 'em by smiling,
                       Em
he could leave them to hang.
               A
They came on so loaded, man,
          C
well hung, snow white tan....


[Chorus]

Am    G5              F5    G5 Am
 So where were the spiders,
         G5                F5         G5 Am
While the fly tried to break our balls?
           G5           F5
Just the beer light to guide us,
    G5 D                 Dsus2
so  we bitched about his fans
D             E
and should we crush his sweet hands?


[Interlude]

G D Cadd9 G/B G/A  
G D Cadd9 G/B G/A  


[Verse 3]

G
Ziggy played for time,
Bm                        C
Jiving us that we were voodoo.
        B    C    D
The kids were just crass,
          G
He was the nazz,
              Em
With God given ass.
          A
He took it all too far,
                  C
But, boy, Could he play guitar!


[Chorus 2]

Making love to his ego,
Ziggy sucked up into his mind,
Like a leper Messiah,
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band!


[Interlude]

G D Cadd9 G/B G/A  
G D Cadd9 G/B G/A  


[Outro]

G   D Cadd9 G/B G/A    G D
Yeah...         ooo.... 
Cadd9           G
ZIGGY PLAYED GUITAR!

We can be us,  just for one day


[Verse 2]

C         F
I, I can remember
C                F
Standing, by the wall
       C           F
And the guns, shot above our heads
      C                               F
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall
       Bb                C
And the shame, was on the other side
         Gm7       Dm                C
Oh we can beat them,     for ever and ever
                Bb      F               C
Then we could be Heroes,    just for one day

C         F
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes  Just for one day
We can be Heroes

Sur La Route De Memphis
mardi 18 juillet 2017

           E             A
    J'écoutais le disc-jockey
             E      G#m        C#m
    Dans la voiture qui m'emportait
                     F#m       A
    Sur la route de Memphis
                    E          A    E
    Sur la route de Memphis

    Et la radio me vantait
    Un truc débile qui m'endormait
    Sur la route de Memphis
    Sur la route de Memphis

    B                     A                        E        A   E
    Je viens vers toi tu m'attends dans ta robe blanche
    B                      A                       E       B
    L'amour en province ressemble un peu à un dimanche

    Sur le siège avant le chauffeur
    Buvait de la bière en regardant l'heure
    Sur la route de Memphis
    Sur la route de Memphis

    A la place du mort un chien loup
    Me jetait un regard un peu fou
    Sur la route de Memphis
    Sur la route de Memphis

    B                     A                        E        A   E
    Je viens vers toi mais pas dans une roll's blanche
    B                      A                       E       C
    Dans un costume un peu élimé aux manches

             F                       La#
    J'ai le droit de me taire et fumer
           F           Lam           Dm
    En gardant mes menottes aux poignets
                       Gm     A#
    Sur la route de Memphis
                      Fa     Si   Fa
    Sur la route de Memphis

    Pour une fois les flics ont gagné
    Et chez toi je ne fais que passer
    Sur la route de Memphis
    Sur la route de Memphis

Couleur Menthe A l'Eau
mardi 18 juillet 2017
13:32
                 F 
Elle était maquillée
                  G(sus4) 
Comme une star de ciné
G                Am 
Accoudée au juke-box
G            Am 
La la la la la
                    G    F 
Elle rêvait qu'elle po..sait
                      G(sus4) 
Juste pour un bout d'essai
G            Am 
A la Century Fox
G     Am 
La la la

                            Bm7 
Elle semblait bien dans sa peau
                           Fmaj7 
Ses yeux couleur menthe à l'eau
                       G(sus4) 
Cherchait du regard un spot
G                C 
Le dieu projecteur
                        Bm7 
Et moi je n'en pouvais plus
          E7            Fmaj7 
Bien sûr elle ne m'a pas vu
                   G 
Perdue dans sa mégalo
                Am 
Moi j'étais de trop

Elle marchait comme un chat
Qui méprise sa proie
En frôlant le flipper
La la la la la
La chanson qui couvrait
Tous les mots qu'elle mimait
Semblait briser son coeur
La la la

Elle en faisait un peu trop
La fille aux yeux menthe à 1'eau
Hollywood est dans sa tête
Toute seule, elle répète
Son entrée dans un studio
Décor : couleur menthe à l'eau
Perdue dans sa mégalo
Moi je suis de trop

(Orchestre)

Mais un type est entré
Et le charme est tombé
Arrêtant le flipper
La la la la la
Ses yeux noirs ont lancé
De l'agressivité
Sur le pauvre juke-box
La la la

La fille aux yeux menthe à l'eau
A rangé sa mégalo
Et s'est soumise aux yeux noir:
Couleur de trottoir
Et moi je n'en pouvais plus
Elle n'en a jamais rien su
Ma plus jolie des Mytos
Couleur menthe l'eau.

Pictures Of Me
Sunday, December 8, 2013
11:50 AM

Start stop and start 
Stupid acting smart 
Flirting with the flicks 
You say it's just for kicks 
You'll be the victim of your own dirty tricks 
You got yourself to tease and displease 


Doors swinging wide 
You walked in to hide 
Looking at your feet 
Failure's complete 
Saw you and me on the coin-op tv 
Frozen in fear every time we appear 


I'm not surprised and really, why should I be? 
See nothing wrong 
See nothing wrong 
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me 
Completely wrong 
Totally wrong 


Go walking by 
Here come another guy 
Jailer who sells personal hells 
Who'd like to see me down on my fucking knees 
Everybody's dying just to get the disease 


Hey hey hey hey 
I'm not surprised and really, why should I be? 
See nothing wrong 
See nothing wrong 
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me 
Completely wrong 
Totally wrong 
I'm not surprised and really, why should I be? 
See nothing wrong 
See nothing wrong 
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me 
Oh everybody's dying just to get the disease 
Everybody's dying just to get the disease 
Everybody's dying just to get the disease

Am7

[Verse 1]

Am7
Drink up baby,
F9
Stay up all night
        C
With the things you could do,
   G6
You won't but you might.
    Am7
The potential you'll be,
    F9
That you'll never see
   C         E        F
The promises you'll only make.
Am7
Drink up with me now,
 F9
Forget all about
   C
The pressure of days
G6
Do what I say
Am7
And I'll make you okay,
F9
Drive them away,
   C      E             F
The images stuck in your head:


[Chorus]

F     G
The people
Am     Riff 1
You've been before that you
F      G          
Don't want 
Am
Around any more
     F         G
They push, and shove
Am     Riff 2               F
And won't bend to your will
F              Fm
I'll keep them still.


[Verse 2]

Am7
Drink up baby,
F9
Look at the stars.
        C
I'll kiss you again
   G6
Between the bars.
    Am7
I keep seeing you there,
    F9
With your hands in the air
   C         E        F

Keep you apart,
G6
Deep in my heart.
Am7
Separate from the rest
F9
Where I like you the best
   C      E             F
And keep the things you forgot.

F     G
The people
Am     Riff 1
You've been before that you
F      G          
Don't want 
Am
Around any more
     F         G
They push, and shove
Am     Riff 2               F
And won't bend to your will
F              Fm
I'll keep them still.


End on Fm.

Petite Marie

Intro :  Bm   A   D   Bm   G   A   F#   Bm 

        Em             A 
Petite Marie, je parle de toi
              Bm 
Parce qu'avec ta petite voix
             Em                     F# 
Tes petites manies, tu as versé sur ma vie
                 Bm 
Des milliers de roses

Petite furie, je me bats pour toi
Pour que dans dix mille ans de ça
On se retrouve à l'abri,
Sous un ciel aussi joli
Que des milliers de roses

G   A  Je viens du ciel et les étoiles entre elles  Bm  Ne parlent que de toi  G   A  D'un musicien qui fait jouer ses mains  F#  Sur un morceau de bois  G   A   Bm   F#   D   Em  De leur amour plus bleu que le ciel autour 

Petite Marie, je t'attends transi
Sous une tuile de ton toit
Le vent de la nuit froide me renvoie la ballade
Que j'avais écrite pour toi
Petite furie, tu dis que la vie
C'est une bague à chaque doigt
Au soleil de Floride,
Moi mes poches sont vides
Et mes yeux pleurent de froid

Refrain 

         Bm             F# 
Dans la pénombre de ta rue  
        D               Em 
Petite Marie, m'entends-tu?
        G              D          A 
Je n'attends plus que toi pour partir
         Bm             F# 
Dans la pénombre de ta rue
        D               Em 
Petite Marie, m'entends-tu?
        G              D          A 
Je n'attends plus que toi pour partir
                     Em    A    Bm 
Et je viens du ciel....
                      Em    F#    Bm 
Et je viens du ciel...

Dm
Depuis le temps que je patiente
F
dans cette chambre noire
                C
J'entends qu'on s'amuse et qu'on chante
          Bbsus2
Au bout du couloir;
Dm
Quelqu'un a touché le verrou
          F
Et j'ai plongé vers le grand jour
           C
J'ai vu les fanfares, les barrières
           Bbsus2
Et les gens autour
Dans les premiers moments j'ai cru
Qu'il fallait seulement se défendre
Mais cette place est sans issue
Je commence à comprendre
Ils ont refermé derrière moi
Ils ont eu peur que je recule
Je vais bien finir par l'avoir
Cette danseuse ridicule…
[Riff 1]
                       [Riff 2]
Est-ce que ce monde est sérieux ? x2
Andalousie je me souviens
Les prairies bordées de cactus
Je ne vais pas trembler devant
Ce pantin, ce minus !
Je vais l'attraper, lui et son chapeau
Les faire tourner comme un soleil
Ce soir la femme du torero
Dormira sur ses deux oreilles
Est-ce que ce monde est sérieux ?
Bbsus2                        Csus2
J'en ai poursuivi des fantômes
                    Dm         Dsus2       Dsus4      Dm
Presque touché leurs ballerines
Dm             Bbsus2
Ils ont frappé fort dans mon cou
             Asus4     A    Asus4    Asus2     
  A
Pour que je m'incline
A                       Bbsus2
Ils sortent d'où ces acrobates
Csus2                  Dm    Dsus2   Dsus4   Dm
Avec leurs costumes de papier ?
Dm           Bbsus2
J'ai jamais appris à me battre
           Csus2
Contre des poupées
Bbsus2        Csus2
Sentir le sable sous ma tête
C'est fou comme ça peut faire du bien
J'ai prié pour que tout s'arrête
Andalousie je me souviens
Je les entends rire comme je râle
Je les vois danser comme je succombe
Je ne pensais pas qu'on puisse autant
S'amuser autour d'une tombe
Est-ce que ce monde est sérieux ?
Est-ce que ce monde est sérieux ?…
Si, si hombre hombre
Baila, baila
Hay que bailar de nuevo
Y mataremos otros
Otras vidas, otros toros
Y mataremos otros
Venga, venga
Venga, venga a bailar…

Les Passantes

Artists: #Georges Brassens 

Les Passantes - George Brassens

Am
F                     E7
Je veux dédier ce poème,
A7                         D
à toutes les femmes qu'on aime,
Am                   G7   C       E
Pendant quelques instants secrets,
F                  E7
à celles qu'on connaît à peine,
        A7             D
Qu'un destin différent entraîne,
 Am       G7         Am
Et qu'on ne retrouve jamais.

 F                         E7
à celles qu'on voit apparaître,
A7                   D
Une seconde, à sa fenêtre,
Am               G7        C      E
Et qui, presque, s'évanouit,
F              E7
Mais dont la svelte silhouette
A7                   D
Est si gracieuse et fluette
Am        G7       Am
Qu'on en demeure épanoui.

 F                  E7
à la compagne de voyage,
A7                         D
Dont les yeux, charmant paysage,
Am                    G7     C      E
Font paraître court le chemin;
F                 E7
Qu'on est seul peut-être a comprendre,
A7                          D
Et qu'on laisse pourtant descendre
Am          G7       Am
Sans avoir effleure sa main.

 

 F                  E7
à celles qui sont déjà prises,
A7                         D
Et qui, vivant des heures grises,
Am                    G7     C      E
Près d'un être trop différent,
F                 E7
Vous ont, inutile folie,
A7                    D
Laissé voir la mélancolie
Am          G7       Am
D'un avenir désespérant.

 F                  E7
Chères images aperçues,
A7                         D
Espérances d'un jour déçues,
Am                    G7     C      E
Vous serez dans l'oubli demain;
F                         E7
Pour peu que le bonheur survienne,
A7                         D
Il est rare qu'on se souvienne,
Am          G7       Am
Des épisodes du chemin.

 F                  E7
Mais si l'on a manqué sa vie,
A7                         D
On songe, avec un peu d'envie
Am                 G7     C      E
à tous ces bonheurs entrevus,
F                             E7
Aux baisers qu'on n'osa pas prendre,
A7                             D
Aux cœurs qui doivent vous attendre,
Am          G7            Am
Aux yeux qu'on n'a jamais revus.

 F                  E7
Alors, aux soirs de lassitude,
A7                         D
Tout en peuplant sa solitude
Am              G7     C      E
Des fantômes du souvenir,
F                         E7
On pleure les lèvres absentes
A7                          D
De toutes ces belles passantes
Am          G7          Am
Que l'on a n'a pas su retenir.

Scarlet Town
mardi 14 février 2017

"Scarlet Town"

Am
Buddy I went down to Scarlet Town
Never been there before
You slept on a feather bed
I slept on the floor

I don't mind a lean old time
Or drinking my coffee cold
But the things I seen in Scarlet Town
Did mortify my soul


Am           G    D
Look at that deep well
Am           G    D
Look at that dark grave
Am           G    D
Ringing that iron bell
G            D    Am     (not sure. C D Am works too, as well as C G Am)
In Scarlet Town today

Am G D x3
G D Am (not sure)

I spent some time in New Orleans
And came along a bend
But Scarlet Town brought me down
Low as I ever been

Look at that deep well
Look at that dark grave
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

On the day I came to Scarlet Town
You promised I'd be your bride
You left me here to rot away
Like holly on a mountainside

Look at that deep well
Look at that dark ray
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

Now you may hide in Scarlet Town
For a hundred years or more
But the man who knows what time it is
Is knocking at the door

So fare you well, my own true love
If you never see me around
I'll be looking through a telescope
From hell to Scarlet Town

Look at that deep well
Look at that dark ray
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

Artists: #Graeme Allwright 

 G                   C 
Ecoute la balade,de la désescalade
D                                G 
Il n'est pas trop tard,pour commencer
                        C            D 
Plus toutes ces salades qui retardent la venue

Du jour de clarté

La la la (même air, mêmes accords)

         G                     C 
Partons tous à la croisade,de la désescalade
D                              G 
Avis à tous ceux,qui veulent monter.
                              C 
Pour sortir de la panade,des frites et des grillades
D                                   G 
Un peu moins chaque jours,et c'est gagné.

La la la 

D 
Tous les jours c'est la guerre des nerfs
C 
Tous les jours sur cette bonne vieille terre
D 
Sur les prairies de Normandie
    C 
Les vaches machent et les vaches chient
    D 
Et dans les bistrots du vieux Paris
      C 
On en fait autant avec esprit.
          G 
Dans les yeux où le rouge et le jaune se mèle
        D                C           G 
On commente les toutes dernières nouvelles
    G                    C 
La douce sérénade,de la désescalade
        D            G 
Contre la fanfaronade de l'absurdité.
     G        C 
La désescalade,pourquoi est-ce qu'on tarde
D                                 G 
Qu'est-ce qu'on attend pour commencer.

La la la la

J'ai voyagé de Brest à Besançon
       A                     D
Depuis la Rochelle jusqu'en Avignon
De Nantes jusqu'à Monaco
    A7                      D
En passant par Metz et Saint-Malo
   D
Et Paris
        D
Et j'ai vendu des marrons à la foire de Dijon

Et d'la barbe à papa

Je ne veux plus voyager

J'ai attrapé la grippe et des idées noires

J'ai eu mal aux dents et la rougeole
         A7                                  D
J'ai attrapé des rhumes et des p'tites bestioles

Sans parler de toutes les fois que j'ai coupé mes doigts
A7                   D
Sur une boîte à sardines

D
Je les vois tous les deux comme si c'était hier
 A                                   D
Au coucher du soleil, Maman mettant l'couvert
      D 
Et mon vieux Papa avec sa cuillère
      A7                             D
Remplissant son assiette de pommes de terre
    D
Bien cuites

Et les dimanches Maman coupant une tranche
  A7        D
De tarte aux pommes

C             G7
Dans son manteau rouge et blanc  
           F                 G7  
Sur un traîneau porté par le vent 
         C               F 
Il descendra par la cheminée

Petit garçon, il est l'heure d'aller se coucher. 
Refrain

Entends-tu les clochettes tintinnabuler? 
Et, demain matin, petit garçon, 
Tu trouveras dans tes chaussons 
Tous les jouets dont tu as rêvés 
Petit garçon, il est l'heure d'aller se coucher. 
Refrain 
Et, demain matin, petit garçon, 
Tu trouveras dans tes chaussons 
Tous les jouets dont tu as rêvés 
Et, maintenant, il est l'heure d'aller se coucher.

C                                   F                 C
Le temps est loin de nos vingt ans, des coups de poing des coups de sang
                 F                  C                            G7                 C

Refrain
F                   G7                 F      G7        C
Buvons encore une dernière fois à l'amitié l'amour la joie

On a fêté nos retrouvailles, ça m'fait de la peine, mais il faut que je m'en aille
C                           F                   C
Et souviens-toi de cet été, la première fois qu'on s'est saoulé
           F          C                     G7            C
Tu m'as ram'né à la maison, en chantant on marchait à reculons.
Refrain
C             F                             C
Je suis parti changer d'étoile, sur un navire j'ai mis la voile
            F         C                     G7                    C
Pour n'être plus qu'un étranger, ne sachant plus très bien où il allait.
Refrain
C                  F                 C
J't'ai raconté mon mariage, à la mairie d'un p'tit village

Je rigolais dans mon plastron, quand l'maire essayait de prononcer mon nom.
Refrain
C               F                         C
J 'n'ai pas écrit toutes ces années, et toi aussi t'es marié

T'as trois enfants à faire manger, mais j'en ai cinq si ça peut te consoler.
F                  G7                 F      G7        C
Buvons encore une dernière fois à l'amitié l'amour la joie

Jusqu'à La Ceinture
mercredi 15 mars 2017
13:14

Au choix : Am - G - F - E ou Am - C - F - E

En mil-neuf-cent-quarante-deux
Alors que j' étais  à l'armée    
On était  en manoeuvre dans la Louisiane
Une nuit au mois de mai
Le capitaine nous montre un fleuve
Et c'est comme ça que tout a commencé. 
On avait d'la flotte jusqu'aux g'noux
Et le vieux con a dit d'avancer 

Le sergent dit : " Mon capitaine,  ... 
Etes-vous sûr qu'c'est le chemin ? " 
- " Sergent, j'ai traversé souvent 
Et je connais bien le terrain 
Allons, soldats, un peu de courage ! 
On n'est pas là pour s'amuser " 
Y'en avait jusqu'à la ceinture 
Et le vieux con a dit d'avancer 

Le sergent dit : " On est trop chargés 
On ne pourra pas nager " 
- " Sergent ne sois pas si nerveux 
Il faut un peu de volonté 
Suivez-moi : je marcherai devant 
Je n'aime pas les dégonflés " 
On avait d'la flotte jusqu'au cou 
Et le vieux con a dit d'avancer 

Dans la nuit, soudain, un cri jaillit 
Suivi d'un sinistre glou-glou 
Et la casquette du capitaine 
Flottait à côté de nous 
Le sergent cria : " Retournez-vous 
C'est moi qui commande à présent " 
On s'en est sortis juste à temps 
Le capitaine est mort là-dedans 

Le lendemain, on a trouvé son corps 
Enfoncé dans les sables mouvants 
Il s'était trompé de cinq cents mètres 
Sur le chemin qui mène au camp 
Un affluent se jetait dans le fleuve 
Où il croyait la terre tout près 
On a eu d'la chance de s'en tirer 
Quand le vieux con a dit d'avancer 

La morale de cette triste histoire 
Je vous la laisse deviner 
Mais vous avez peut-être mieux à faire 
Vous n'vous sentez pas concernés 
Mais chaque fois que j'ouvre mon journal 
On avait d'la flotte jusqu'aux genoux 
Et le vieux con a dit d'avancer 
Y'en avait d'la flotte jusqu'à la ceinture 
Et le vieux con a dit d'avancer 
Y'en avait d'la flotte jusqu'au cou 
Et le vieux con a dit d'avancer...

Fmaj7   Dm7 
When I look into your   eyes
   C 
I can see a love res    trained
Fmaj7   Dm7 
But darling when I  hold you
   C 
Don’t you know I feel the   same
Dm7     G 
Cause nothin’ lasts for ever
   C 
And we both know hearts can     change
Dm7     G 
And it’s hard to hold a     candle
   C 
In the cold november    rain

Fmaj7   Dm7 
We’ve been through this such a l    ong, long time
   C 
Just tryin’ to kill the     pain, oh yeah
Fmaj7 
But lovers always come and lovers always go
   Dm7     C 
And     no one’s really sure who’s lettin’ go   today, walkin’ away
Fmaj7 
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
Dm7 
I could rest my head
   C 
Just knowin’ that you were  mine, all mine

Dm7     G 
So if you want to   love me
   C 
Then darlin’ don’t  refrain
Dm7     G 
Or I’ll just end up     walkin’
   C 
In the cold november    rain

Fmaj7   G 
Do you need sometime on your    own?
   Fmaj7   G 
Do you  need sometime all   alone?
   Fmaj7   G 
Everybody   needs sometime on their     own
   Fmaj7   G 
Don’t you know you  need sometime all   alone

Em  Fmaj7   C 
I know it’s     hard to keep an     open heart
Em  Fmaj7   Dm7 
When even   friends seem out to     harm you
Em  Fmaj7   C 
But if you  could heal a    broken heart
Em  Fmaj7   G 
Wouldn’t    time be out to  charm you, whoa...

C   C 
I usually skip this part
Fmaj7   G 
Sometimes I need sometime on my     own
   Fmaj7   G 
Sometimes I     need sometime all   alone
   Fmaj7   G 
Everybody   needs sometime on their     own
   Fmaj7   G 
Don’t you know you  need sometime all   alone

Fmaj7 
And when your fears subside
Dm7     C 
And shadows still   remain, oh yeah
Fmaj7   Dm7 
I know that you can     love me
   C 
When there’s no one left to     blame
Dm7     G 
So never mind the   darkness
   C 
We still can find a     way
Dm7     G 
Cause nothin’ lasts     forever
   C 
Even cold november  rain

C   G/B     Am7     G   Fma7    G   C   Cm 
Ending on Cm is my nod to the outro that doesn’t work in a solo performance

Sweet Child O' Mine
mardi 2 janvier 2018
11:53
[Verse]
D  
He's got a smile that it seems to me 
C9  
Reminds me of childhood memories 
     G  
Where  everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky 
D 
Now and then when I see his face 
C9 
It takes me away to that special place 
        G                                           D  
and if I   stay too long I'd probably break down and  cry 
[Chorus]
C9  G                      D   
Oh     oh, sweet child of     mine 
C9       G                     D  
Oh, oh,     oh, sweet love of     mine 
[Verse]
D  
He's got eyes of the bluest sky 
C9 
and if they thought of rain 
    G                                    D   
I'd     hate to look into those eyes and     see an ounce of pain 
D  
His hair reminds me of a warm safe place 
C9 
where as a child I'd hide 
    G                                           D   
and     pray for the thunder and for the rain to   quietly pass me by 
[Chorus]
C9  G                      D   
Oh     oh, sweet child of     mine 
C9       G                     D  
Oh, oh,     oh, sweet love of     mine 
 C9          G                     D   
Oh, oh, oh,     oh sweet child of     mine 
             C9      G               D   
Hey, hey-hey     Oh    sweet love of mine

[Verse 1]

Em
Look at your young men fighting
G
Look at your women crying
Em
Look at your young men dying
G                                 D/F#
The way they've always done before 

Em
Look at the hate we're breeding
G
Look at the fear we're feeding
Em
Look at the lives we're leading
G                               D/F#
The way we've always done before

A5  A#4  A7

                   E5
My hands are tied
     G                                  D/F#
The billions shift from side to side
           E5
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
          G                            D
For the love of God and our human rights
      Em
And all these things are swept aside
     G                                   D/F#
By bloody hands time can't deny
           E5
And are washed away by your genocide
      G                       D                   A
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

B/A  C/A  D/A

            G                      Bm
D'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
            Em
Who said     "Peace could last forever"
         G                   Bm
And in my first memories they shot Kennedy
Em                 C        D         G               Bm
I went numb when I learned to see so I never fell for Vietnam
          Em                                     G
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all that you can't trust freedom
         Bm                      Em
When it's not in your hands when everybody's fightin'
         C        D
For their promised land And


[Chorus]

G            Bm             Em
   I don't need your civil war
G                Bm                       Em   C  D
   It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
G                 Bm                        Em
   You're power hungry sellin' soldier In a      human grocery store Ain't that fresh

   I don't need your civil war

Em
Look at the shoes you're filling
G
Look at the blood we're spilling
Em
Look at the world we're killing
G                               D/F#
The way we've always done before

Em
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
G
Look at the leaders we've followed
Em
Look at the lies we've swallowed
G                           D/F# 
And I don't want to hear no more

A5  A#4  A7

                   E5
My hands are tied
     G                                        D/F#
For all I've seen has changed my mind
                E5
But still the wars go on and the years go by
           G                   D                            Em
With no love of God or human rights 'cause all these dreams are swept aside
    G                                    D/F#
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
       E5
Who carry the cross of homicide
      G                       D                      A
And history bears the scars of our civil wars

Black Is The Colour

Sympa en arpèges

[Verse 1]
Am                  F           G          Am
      black is the colour of my true loves hair
                    F           G      E7
       her lips are like some roses fair
                            F    G                E7
       she had the sweetest smile and the gentelest hands
                      F      G         Am
       and i love the ground whereon she stands
[Verse 2]
i love my love and well she knows
      i love the ground whereon she goes
      i wish the day it soon would come
      when she and i would be as one
[Verse 3]
i go to the clyde and i mourn and weep
      for satisfied i ne 'er can be
      i wrote her a letter just a few short lines 
      and suffer death a thousand times

[Repeat Verse 1]

The Smoker's Song

SMOKER'S SONG
(Peter Ross, Hamish Imlach)

3/4, in C


C         G      C        F                 C
Now I'm a social outcast, A modern-day refugee.
F            G            F           G
Joy turns to gloom when I walk into a room.
D                             G
They all turn their back upon me.
C         G         C       F                        E
I'm not a thug or a mugger. I've not murdered anyone yet.
F                         G              Am
But you would think I was Charles bloody Manson
D               G          C-B-bB-Am     D  G  C
when I light up a cigarette.

Some folk get their kicks from alcohol.
Some stuff their nose with cocaine.
Some folk like knocking old women about.
Some like tae batter their weans.
There's masochists, sadists, and rapists,
folk that like dressing in drag.
I'm no' like them. That's no' my game.
Gimme peace just to light one more fag.

You can snuff it doing too much exercise.
You can snuff it not doing enough.
You can snuff it by eating too little.
You know, you can snuff it eating too much. (pause)
You can snuff it staying out late at night.
You can snuff it lying in your bed.
So my way of snuffing is to keep right on puffing.
It's on my own bloody head.

Spare a thought for all the smokers
Doing their bit for the Crown.
Remember when a smoker lights up,
he's keeping your income tax down.
Yes, he is. He's keeping your income tax down.

And I know a spot right over the hill.

There's soda pop and the dancin's free,

  C
No more lookin',

D                   G           C 
How's about keepin' steady company? 

F                                        C
I'm gonna throw my date-book over the fence
F                                 C
And find me one for five or ten cents. 
F                                    C
I'll keep it 'til it's covered with age
  D                                   G
'Cause I'm writin' your name down on every page.

[Chorus]

Move It On Over

Move it on Over by Hank Williams

E
Came in last night at half past ten
E
That baby of mine wouldn't let me in
A
So move it on over (move it on over)
E
Move it on over (move it on over)
B7                                  E
Move over little dog cause the big dog's moving in

She's changed the lock on my front door
My door key don't fit no more
So get it on over (move it on over)
Scoot it on over (move it on over)
Move over skinny dog cause the fat dog's moving in

This dog house here is mighty small
But it's better than no house at all
So ease it on over (move it on over)
Drag it on over (move it on over)
Move over old dog cause a new dog's moving in

She told me not to play around
But I done let the deal go down
So pack it on over (move it on over)
Tote it on over (move it on over)
Move over nice dog cause a mad dog's moving in

She warned me once, she warned me twice
But I don't take no one's advice
So scratch it on over (move it on over)
Shake it on over (move it on over)
Move over short dog cause the tall dog's moving in

She'll crawl back to me on her knees
I'll be busy scratching fleas
So slide it on over (move it on over)
Sneak it on over (move it on over)
Move over good dog cause a mad dog's moving in

Remember pup, before you whine
That side's yours and this side's mine
So shove it on over (move it on over)
Sweep it on over (move it on over)
Move over cold dog cause a hot dog's moving in

Cold Cold Heart

COLD COLD HEART
written and recorded by Hank Williams

C                                                    G7
I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream
                                                   C
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
                                      C7        F
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
   G7                                                      C
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your Cold Cold Heart

                                                  G7
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
                                                 C
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
                                   C7                 F
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start 
  G7                                                      C
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your Cold Cold Heart

                                                     G7
You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
                                                       C
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
                                    C7                F
Why do you run and hide from life to try it just ain't smart
   G7                                                      C
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your Cold Cold Heart

                                                    G7
There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
                                            C
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
                                    C7             F
The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart
   G7                                                      C
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your Cold Cold Heart

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
D        A           G     A
Et même si le temps presse
D          A          G    A
Même s'il est un peu court
D        A              G     A
Si les années qu'on me laisse
D            A          G    A
Ne sont que minutes et jours
D        A           G   A
Et même si l'on m'arrête
D             A          G   A
Ou s'il faut briser des murs
D             A            G     A
En soufflant dans les trompettes
D        A        G    G
Ou à force de murmures

[Chorus]

D        A            G  A
Et même s'il faut partir
D           A           G    A
Changer de terre ou de trace
D              A            G  A
S'il faut chercher dans l'exil
D            A        G   A
L'empreinte de mon espace
D        A         G    A
Et même si les tempêtes

Les dieux mauvais les courants

A9              E            B4           C#m 
Un début de Janvier, si j'ai bien su compter 
A9                  E       B4            C#m 
Restes de fête ou bien de voeux très appuyés 
A9                E     B4            C#m 
De Ruth ou de Moïshé, lequel a eu l'idée ? 
A9                       E          B4             C#m 
Qu'importe j'ai gagné la course, et parmi des milliers 
A9                        E               B4               C#m 
Nous avons tous été vainqueurs, même le dernier des derniers 
A9                          E    B4                C#m 
Une fois au moins les meilleurs, nous qui sommes nés 
A9                 E     B4            C#m 
Au creux de nos mères, qu'il fait bon mûrir 
A9                       E    B4               C#m 
Et puis j'ai vu de la lumière alors je suis sorti 
               (RIFF) 
Et j'ai dit  .....  Bonne idée 


A9         E        B4                     C#m 
Y'avait du soleil, des parfums, de la pluie 
A9                      E        B4                        C#m 
Chaque jours un nouveau réveil, chaque jour une autre nuit 
A9                   E           B4            C#m 
Des routes et des motards et des matches de rugby 
A9                      E        B4                C#m 
Des spaghetti, Frédéric Dard et Johnny Winter aussi 
A9                      E         B4             C#m 
On m'a dit c'est qu'une étincelle avant l'obscurité 
A9                          E      B4                C#m  
Juste un passage, un arc en ciel, une étrange absurdité
A9                    E      B4              C#m 
Des frères , des tendres, des trésors à chercher 
A9                 E             B4                        C#m 
Des vertiges à prendre, à comprendre et des filles à caresser 
              (RIFF) 
Et j'ai dit  .....  Bonne idée 


A                     Dsus2          E                A 
Il puis y'a toi qui débarque en ouvrant grand mes rideaux 
Dsus2                      A            Dsus2                 E
Et des flots de couleurs éclatent et le beau semble bien plus beau 
A                    Dsus2    E                 F#m
Et rien vraiment ne change mais tout est différent 
Dsus2                   A             E             F#m
Comme ces festins qu'on mange seul ou en les partageant

Je marchais au hasard, le soir était tombé 
A9                    E              B4         C#m 
Avec mon sac et ma guitare j'étais un peu fatigué 
A9              E     B4            C#m 
Tout était si désert, où me désaltérer ? 
A9                       E       B4                C#m 
Et puis j'ai vu de la lumière et je vous ai trouvés

Am  C D Am  C D Am
[Verse 1]
C      D      Am         C      D       Am
I hurt myself today   to see if I still feel
C       D      Am         C       D        Am
I focus on the pain   the only thing that's real
C        D        Am          C      D      Am
The needle tears a hole   the old familiar sting
    C       D      Am           C       D       G          
Try to kill it all away   but I remember everything
[Chorus]
Am          F             C        G
What have I become?   My sweetest friend
Am          F           C          G
Everyone I know   goes away in the end
Am                     F         C       G
And you could have it all   My empire of dirt
Am              F             G        Am
I will let you down   I will make you hurt
[Verse 2]
C           D        Am         C      D     Am
I wear this crown of thorns   upon my liars chair
C          D        Am    C     D     Am
Full of broken thoughts   I cannot repair
C           D         Am         C       D      Am
Beneath the stains of time   the feeling disappears
C         D      Am    C     D     G
You are someone else   I am still right here
[Chorus 2]
Am          F             C        G
What have I become?   My sweetest friend
Am          F           C          G
Everyone I know   goes away in the end
Am                     F         C       G
And you could have it all   My empire of dirt
Am              F             G        Am
I will let you down   I will make you hurt
Am                 F         C           G
If I could start again  a million miles away
Am              F      G           Am
I would keep myself  I would find a way

[Verse 1]
B7 --> alternating bass              E
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
         B7                     E
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
          A                         E
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds

Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
         E7                         A
I find myself alone when each day is through
           D                  A
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
              E7               A

I keep you on my mind both day and night
         G                               D
And happiness I've known proves that it's right

You give me cause for love that I can't hide

For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide

E             
I hear the train a-coming, it's rolling round the bend
                                               E7  
and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
   A                                              E    
I'm stuck at Folsom Prison, and time keeps draggin' on
        B7                                    E
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone
E
When I was just a baby, my Mama told me 'Son,
                                          E7
always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns.'
     A                                       E
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
      B7                                           E
when I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and cry
[Guitar solo/interlude]
E
I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
                                          E7
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
     A                                       E
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
      B7                                       E
But those people keep a moving, and that's what tortures me
[Guitar solo/interlude]
E
Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
                                          E7
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
     A                                       E
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay
      B7                                           E
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

Wayfaring Stranger
lundi 6 février 2017

Am
I'm just a poor

Wayfaring stranger
            Dm
Travelling through
            Am
This world below

There is no sickness

No toil, nor danger
               Dm
In that bright land
E           Am
To which i go


[Chorus]

           F
I'm going there
          C
To see my father
           F
And all my loved ones
           E  E7 E
Who've gone on
         Am
I'm just going over jordan
        Dm  E       Am
I'm just going over home


[Instrumental]

Am  Dm  E  Am      Am  Dm  E  Am


[Verse]

Am
I know dark clouds

Will gather round me
         Dm 
I know my way
            Am
Is hard and steep

But beautious fields

Arise before me
           Dm 
Where god redeems
Em            Am
There vigils keep


[Chorus]

           F
I'm going there
          C
To see my mother
               F
She said she'd meet me
       E  E7 E
When I come
         Am
I'm just going over jordan
        Dm  E       Am  (end dead on this chord)
I'm just going over home

To Beat The Devil
lundi 6 février 2017

            Verse 1:(spoken)
         G                              C/G                G 
It was winter time in Nashville,down on music city row
                                         D                          C/G
And i was lookin' for a place to get myself out of the cold
                                          G             Em    C/G
To warm the frozen feelin' that was eatin' at my soul
                                         D
And keep the chilly wind off my guitar


Verse 2:(spoken)
         G                         C/G             G  
My thirsty wanted whisky,my hungry needed beans
                                                 D 
But it'd been of month of paydays since i've heard that eagle scream
           C/G                         G                        Em     C/G
So with my stomach full of empty and my pockets full of dreams
                                            D            
I left my pride and stepped inside a bar


Bridge:(spoken)
        Em                                      C/G  
Actually i guess you'd could call it a Tavern...
                                                             D   
Cigarette smoke to the ceiling and stardust on the floor
                          G
Friendly shadows


Verse 3:(spoken)
          G                                 C/G             G  
I saw that there was just one old man sittin' at the bar
                                                    D              C/G 
And in the mirror i could see him checkin' me and my guitar
                         G                       Em                   C/G  
He turned,and said "Come up here boy,and show us what you are"
                                            D
I said "I'm dry"-and he brought me a beer


Verse 1-bis:(spoken)
           G                             C/G                   G   
He nodded at my guitar and said "It's a tough life,ain't it"
                                               D                               C/G                   
I just looked at him,and he said "You ain't makin' any money,are you?"
                                           G                         Em                       C/G     
I said "You've been readin' my mail".He just smiled and said "Let me see your guitar"
         C/G                           G
I've got something you want to hear.Then he laid it on me


Verse sang 1:
          G                                     C/G    
If you waste your time of talkin' to the people who don't listen
                G                                    D
To the things that you are sayin',who do you think's gonna hear
               G                                 C/G 
And if you should die explaining how the things that they complain about
             G                                     D               G     
Are things they could be changin' who do you think's gonna care
                  D                           C/G                   G             
There were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind
                                                   D
Who were crucified for what they tried to show
                  G                                   C/G                G   
And their voice's have been scattered by this world and winds of times
                                    D                G  
Cause the truth remains that no one wants to know


Verse 4:(spoken)
         G                                    C/G                G  
Well,the old man was a stranger,but i'd heard his song before
                                       D                          C/G
Back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door
                                         G                Em   C/G  
When no one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor
                                             D
And lonesome was more than a state of mind


Verse 2-bis:(spoken)
            G                               C/G                           G
You see,the devil haunts a hungry man,and if you don't wanna join him
                    D       C/G
You got to beat him
                                      G                 Em               C/G
I ain't sayin' i beat the devil but i drank his beer for nothing
                         G
Then i stole his song


Verse sang 2:
                G                                C/G 
And you still can hear me singin' to the people who don't listen
                G                              D
To the things that i am sayin',prayin' someones gonna hear
              G                                C/G 
And i guess i'll die explainig how the things that they complain about
             G                                   D               G
Are things they could be changin',hopin' someones gonna care
              D                            C/G              G            
I was born a lonely singer,and i'm bound to die the same
                                              D
But i've got to feed the hunger in my soul
                 G                          C/G          G 
And if i never have a nickle i won't ever die ashamed
                                  D                 G 
Cause i don't believe that no one wants to know

Me And Bobby McGee
lundi 6 février 2017

[Intro]
G - C/G   G - C/G   G
[Verse]
G               G          G                G
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
        G                G        D7      D7
When I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
D7               D7        D7               D7
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
    D7              D7            G - C/G    G
And rode us all the way into New Orleans
G             G             G             G
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
   G                   G7              C    C
I's playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues
C                   C                 G                G
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
D7             D7               D7   D7
We sang every song that driver knew
[Chorus]
C                C             G                 G
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
D7                 D7                          G    G
Nothin', it ain't nothin' honey, if it ain't free
   C                C              G                 G
And feelin' good was easy, lord, oh, when he sang the blues
        D7               D7               D7  D7
You know feelin' good was good enough for me
D7               D7               G    G    A    A
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
[Verse]
A         A                A          A
From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun
    A                 A          E7      E7
Yeah Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
       E7            E7              E7             E7
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
    E7         E7               A     A
Yeah Bobby baby kept me from the cold
A              A            A                 A
One day up near Salinas, lo-ord, I let him slip away
    A                 A7                 D        D
He's lookin' for that home and I hope he finds it
        D               D              A            A
Well I'd trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday
     E7               E7           E7   E7
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
[Chorus]
D                D             A                 A
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
E7                   E7             A       A
Nothin', and that's all that Bobby left me
     D                D          A                     A
Well, feelin' good was easy, lo-o-ord, when he sang the blues
   E7               E7               E7  E7
And feelin' good was good enough for me
E7               E7               A         A
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee yeah

I think it sounds better if you play it with your fingers and not with a
pic. So just strumm the low string with your thumb with a down-stroke and
the high string with your index finger with an up-stroke.
[Verse]
G        Gmaj7            G6           G
Spent my days with a woman unkind
G         Gmaj7     G6       G          D
smoked my stuff and drank               all my wine
Made up my mind make a new start
goin' California with an achin in my heart
someone told me there's a girl out there,
with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair
took my chances on a big jet plane,
never let them you that they're all the same
oh, sea was red ant the sky was grey,
wondered howw tomorroew could ever follow today
mountains and the cayons start to tremble and shake,
chilrden of the sun begin to awake
Dm                                                                      
seems that the wrath of the gods got a punch on the nose, ant it started to 
                       A7
flow i think i might be sinkin'
Dm                                                                         
Throw me a line if i reach you in time, meet me up there where the path runs
            A7 
straight and high.
[Outro]
G        Gmaj7            G6     G
To find a queen without a king, 
G                  Gmaj7        G6   G              D  
they say she plays guitar and cries                and sings             lalalala
ride a white a mare in the footsteps of dawn,
tryin' to find a woman who's never nerver been born
standing on a hill in the mountains of dreams,
telling myself it's not as hard, hard as it seems.

Look out, Ma, there's a white boat comin' up the river   

       C                                          G    C G
With a big red beacon and a flag and a man on the rail

I think you'ld better call John 

                                            Bm        C   
'cause it don't look like they're here to deliver the mail

         Bm7               CM7
And it's less than a mile away

  Bm7                                CM7 
I hope they hope they didn't come to stay

         Bm7                       CM7
It's got numbers on the side and a gun
                     D    
       and it's makin' big waves

G C G C G
        

Daddy's gone and my brother's out huntin' in the mountains
Big John's been drinkin' since the river took Emmy Lou
So the powers that be left me here to do the thinkin'
And I just turned twenty-two
I was wonderin' what to do
And the closer they got
The more those feelin's grew

Daddy's rifle in my hand felt reassurin;
He told me "Red means run, son, and numbers add up to nothin'"
When the first shot hit the dock I saw it comin'
Raised my rifle to my eye
Never stopped to wonder why
Then I saw black and my face splashed in the sky
           
inter-verse

Shelter me from the powder and the finger
Cover me with the one that pulled the trigger
Just think of me as one you never figured
Would fade away so young
With so much left undone
Remember me to my love, I know I'll miss her

F G    Em       F     G              F         C
Oh  Alabama the devil fools with the best laid plans.
F     G      Em
Swing low Alabam
F                     D
You got spare change, you got to feel strange
E                  F           G
And now the moment is all that it meant.

Am
Alabam, you got the weight on your shoulders
      C             D
That's breaking your back.
    Am 
Your Cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch
     C            D
And a wheel on the track

F G    Em   F      G                   F      C
Oh  Alabam, Banjos playing through the broken glass
F       G       Em
Windows down in Alabama.
F                 D
See the old folks tied in white ropes
E               F                 G
Hear the banjo; don't it take you down home?

F G    Em   F     G           F          C
Oh  Alabam; can I see you and shake your hand.
F    G               Em
Make friends down in Alabama.
F         
I'm from a new land
D                 E
I come to you and see all this ruin 
F            G
What are you doin'? 

Am
Alabam,
                                C         D
You got the rest of the union to help you along

What's goin' wrong?

Hello cowgirl in the sand

Can I stay here  for      awhile

         C        F

Hello ruby in the dust
Has your band begun to rust
After all the sin we've had
I was hoping that we'd turn bad

Hello woman of my dreams
Is this not the way it seems
Purple words on a gray background
To be a woman and to be turned down

-----------------------------------------------------------

Acoustically, I play it with the following chords(so I have
half a chance to be able to sing it :-) ) :

verse:  Em       C 
       Em       C 
       G     D   Cmaj7/G  D 
       G     D   Cmaj7/G  D 

chorus: Am  Bm    G C  
       Am  Bm    G C 
       Am  G     C 

(play the following run)

|-------------2----

|------------------

D/F# = 200232
Cmaj7/G = 332000

When I play the C during the verses I hammer on the G string 2nd fret
with my middle finger occasionally.

Needle And The Damage Done

Artists: #Neil Young 
"Needle And The Damage Done"


I caught you knockin'
at my cellar door
I love you, baby,
can I have some more
Ooh, ooh, the damage done.


I hit the city and
I lost my band
I watched the needle
take another man
Gone, gone, the damage done.


I sing the song
because I love the man
I know that some
of you don't understand
Milk-blood
to keep from running out.


I've seen the needle
and the damage done
A little part of it in everyone
But every junkie's
like a settin' sun.

D  A  4x
D       A         G            D
Did I see you down in a young girl's town,
                           A
with your mother in so much pain?
     G      A            Bm         E
I was almost there at the top of the stairs,
        D                A    D
with her screamin' in the rain
D        A     G        D
Did she wake you up to tell you that,
                       A
it was only a change of plan?
G               A          Bm        E
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup,
        D            A    D
with the promise of a man.
D       A       G        D
Did I see you walking with the boys,
                         A
though it was not hand in hand?
       G          A         Bm     E
And was some black face in a lonely place,
    D              A      D
when you could understand?
D        A     G        D
Did she wake you up to tell you that,
                       A
it was only a change of plan?
G               A          Bm        E
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup,
        D            A     D
with the promise of a man.
D       A              G     D
Will I see you give more than I can take?
                   A
Will I only harvest some?
      G        A            Bm       E
As the days fly past will we lose our grasp,
  D              A     D
or fuse it in the sun?
D        A     G        D
Did she wake you up to tell you that,
                       A
it was only a change of plan?
G               A          Bm        E
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup,
D            A     D
with the promise of a man.
G               A          Bm        E
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup,
        D            A     D
with the promise of a man.

Plateau
lundi 17 juillet 2017
11:51
Tuning: Eb

[Intro]
(riff)


[Verse]

G                                    Bb          Fsus2
Many a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateau
G              Bb            Fsus2
Some belong to strangers and some to folks you know
G                                   Bb            Fsus2
Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand
G                                    Bb        Fsus2
To beautify the foothills and shake the many hands

G#


[Chorus]

G                            Bb         Fsus2
The nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
G                  Bb         Fsus2
And an illustrated book about birds
G                          Bb       Fsus2
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
G                     Bb      Fsus2
Who needs action when you got words

riff


[Verse]

G                             Bb               Fsus2
When you've finished with the mop then you can stop
G           Bb          Fsus2
And look at what you've done
G                    Bb            Fsus2
The plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen
G       Bb          Fsus2
And the work it was fun


[Chorus]

G                            Bb         Fsus2
The nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
G                  Bb         Fsus2
And an illustrated book about birds
G                          Bb       Fsus2
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
G                     Bb      Fsus2
Who needs action when you got words

riff


[Verse]

G                            Bb                       Fsus2
Well the many hands began to scan around for the next plateau
G                   Bb                     Fsus2
Some said it was in Greenland and some say Mexico
G                     Bb                           Fsus2
Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood
G                       Bb                               Fsus2
But those were all just guesses, wouldn't help you if they could

I'm A Man You Don't Meet Everyday - as perfomed by The Pogues

     G              D           G         C
Oh my name is Jock Stewart I'm a canny gun man
     G            D           G     D
And a roving young fellow I've been
So be easy and free when you're drinking with me
I'm a man you don't meet every day
[ Tab from: http://www.guitaretab.com/p/pogues/14865.html ]
I have acres of land I have men at command
I have always a shilling to spare
So be easy and free when you're drinking with me
I'm a man you don't meet every day

So come fill up your glasses of brandy and wine
Whatever it costs I will pay
So be easy and free when you're drinking with me
I'm a man you don't meet every day

Break

Well I took out my dog and him I did shoot
All down in the county Kildare
So be easy and free when you're drinking with me
I'm a man you don't meet every day

So come fill up your glasses of brandy and wine
Whatever it costs I will pay
So be easy and free when you're drinking with me
I'm a man you don't meet every day
So be easy and free when you're drinking with me
I'm a man you don't meet every day

La haut sur la montagne
Rien n'existe

Je suis triste
La pluie a mouillé mon coeur
La nuit j'ai froid et j'ai peur
Alors je prie la vierge Notre-Dame
Et c'est elle qui pleure
Sur mon âme

Pastures Of Plenty (Cisco Houston version)

Capo II


Am
It's a mighty hard row that my poor hands have hoed
  C                                   E
My poor feet have traveled a hot dusty road
Am
Out of your Dust Bowl and Westward we rolled
                                  G              Am
And your deserts were hot and your mountains were cold


I worked in your orchards of peaches and prunes
I slept on the ground in the light of the moon
On the edge of the city you'll see us and then
We come with the dust and we go with the wind


California, Arizona, I harvest your crops
Well its North up to Oregon to gather your hops
Dig the beets from your ground, cut the grapes from your vine
To set on your table your light sparkling wine


Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground
From the Grand Coulee Dam where the waters run down
Every state in the Union us migrants have been
We'll work in this fight and we'll fight till we win


It's always we rambled, that river and I
All along your green valley, I will work till I die
My land I'll defend with my life if it be
Cause my pastures of plenty must always be free

C              G             Am      Em
Raindrops like bullets on my fragile skin
       C               G       Am       Em
And the securities I've had are creeping within
       C  G                    Am             Em 
Now I'm 20 miles outside of the place that you live
     C             G               Am             Em   
And I need one more chance now that time's running thin
Em 

C                G           Am         Em           
Well you are the things that make up my dreams
        C           G         Am            Em  
And I've spent every dime that jingles in my jeans
C               G            Am            Em  
I deserve every stone that's thrown out at me
     C             G             Am             Em 
And I think of your smile, I'm in love with your teeth
Em

C               G        Am         Em 
I'm losin' when I am not playin' no games
    C                 G           Am        Em     
Now, would you take me back when I gamble my pain?
C          G                 Am          Em
I've got no direction without her little fingers
C            G           Am                    Em
Barbed wire, razor wire, nothing keeps me from her

C               G          Am               Em 
Now if I had no boots, I'd trek through the mud
     C             G         Am             Em 
While mosquitos are racing to draw the first blood
C         G                      Am          Em  
If you're runnin' away, then I'm lookin' for you
      C                G        Am         Em  
And if you've lost your way, I'm seein' you through.

Le Dragon de Chimay
mercredi 17 août 2016
19:28


Le dragon de Chimay
Barbe Pelot dit la sorcière fût torturée au fond du cachot 
Elle envoya de son bûcher, un dernier sort sur les gens du château 
Ainsi l’promis de la princesse, preux chevalier si tendre et aimant 
Sous la grand’ dalle d’la cathédrale soudainement fut emmuré vivant 

Au cœur du ventre de l’antre l’homme cria du fond des cryptes 
Pour que les pierres le libèrent et nous racontent le temps des mythes 

Le temps passa le sort aussi, l’homme était transformé en bête 
Emprisonné dessous la ville, un feu brûlait tout au fond de son être 
Jusqu’aux passages du souterrain, toutes gargouilles vomissaient de l’eau 
Abreuvant ainsi l’animal, qui chaque jour était de plus en plus gros 

Quand du clocher les carillons, sonnèrent treize coups du même temps 
Réveillant gisants et dragon, dansaient les carillonneurs du grand Satan 
La terre bougea fendant la pierre, laissant entrer espoir et lumière 
Alors la bête brisa ses chaînes, se libérant enfin de son enfer 

Et la princesse triste et dolente, sur la grand’ tour du château d’Chimay 
Gardait son cœur pour un crapaud, mais un dragon volant s’est présenté 
La bête surgie cherchant l’aimée de sa prison s’était extirpée 
Le sort et lui s’sont envolés, les amoureux ils se sont embrasés

che alla fine non si puo' guarire mai
        La                      Mi            La   Mi

        Fa#m                     Re
avere pensato che fossi soltanto mia
        La                 Mi            La   Mi

che mi stessero rubando il tempo e che tu

che tu mi rubi l'amore ma poi ho camminato tanto e fuori

che non ho più pensato a tutte queste cose

Early Morning Rain chords
Gordon Lightfoot

Version I know is by Ian & Silvia, 1965

Capo III

D G A G D G

D                    A
In the early morning rain
G                   D
With a dollar in my hand
                    Em
With an aching in my heart
G                      D
And my pockets full of sand
                    Em
I'm a long ways from home
G                         D
And I missed my loved one so
                    A
In the early morning rain
G                D    
With no place to go

                    A
Out on runway number nine
G              D
Big 707 set to go
                         Em
But I?m stuck here in the grass
G                   D
Where the cold wind blows
                     Em
Now the liquor tasted good
G                      D
And the women all were fast
                      A
Well there she goes my friend
G                     D   G A G D G D
She's rolling down at last

                       A
Hear the mighty engines roar
G                      D
See the silver bird on high
                       Em
She's away and westward bound
G                        D
Far above the clouds she flies
                            Em
Where the morning rain don't fall
G                  D
And the sun always shines
                        A
She'll be flying over my home
G                    D   G A G D G D
In about three hours time

                         A
This old airport?s got me down
G                       D
It's no earthly good to me
                            Em
'Cause I?m stuck here on the ground
G                          D
As cold and drunk as I can be
                    Em
You can't jump a jet plane
G                      D
Like you can a freight train
                  A
So I best be on my way
G                    D
In the early morning rain

                    Em
You can't jump a jet plane
G                      D
Like you can a freight train
                  A
So I best be on my way
G                    D
In the early morning rain

[Intro]

 Am  


[Verse 1]

  Am                       G             Am
As soon as you're born they make you feel small
  Am                    G          Am
By giving you no time instead of it all
        Am                      G          Am
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
 Am                    G            Am
A working class hero is something to be
 Am            G       D            Am
A working class hero is something to be


[Verse 2]

    Am                        G          Am
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
    Am                                 G         Am
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
           Am                         G            Am
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
 Am                    G            Am
A working class hero is something to be
 Am            G       D            Am
A working class hero is something to be


[Verse 3]

            Am                          G          Am
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
Am                      G        Am
Then they expect you to pick a career
        Am                           G          Am
When you can't really function you're so full of fear
 Am                    G            Am
A working class hero is something to be
 Am            G       D            Am
A working class hero is something to be


[Verse 4]

        Am                      G         Am
Keep you doped with religion and sex and T.V.
       Am                         G             Am
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
          Am                        G            Am
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
 Am                    G            Am
A working class hero is something to be
 Am            G       D            Am
A working class hero is something to be


[Verse 5]

       Am                       G           Am
There's room at the top they are telling you still
   Am                          G            Am
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
      Am                  G            Am
If you want to be like the folks on the hill
 Am                    G            Am
A working class hero is something to be
 Am            G       D            Am
A working class hero is something to be


[Outro]

      Am                     G           Am
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
      Am                     G           D          Am
If you want to be a hero well just follow me

[Verse]
      C                  G       C
Oh the year was seventeen-seventy-eight
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now.
 C         G           C        C
A letter of marque came from the king
      C                    G    F
To the scummiest vessel I'd ever seen
[Chorus]
  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold
    G       C
We'd fire no guns
G       F
Shed no tears
     C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateers
[Verse]
  C              G         C
Oh Euclid Barrett cried the town
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
   C            G        C          C
For twenty brave men, all fishermen, who
     C                G          F
Would make for him the Antelope's crew
[Chorus]
  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold
    G       C
We'd fire no guns

Shed no tears
     C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier

The last of Barrett's privateers
[Verse]
   C                    G         C
The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
       C                        G        C
She'd a-list to the port and her sails in rags
       C           C                 G            F
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags
[Chorus]
  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold
    G       C
We'd fire no guns
G       F
Shed no tears
     C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateers
[Verse]
      C                  G      C
On the king's birthday we put to sea
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
       C                G       C
We were ninty-one days to Montego Bay
C            C      G       F        
Pumping like madmen all the way
[Chorus]
  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold

The last of Barrett's privateers
[Verse]
      C                    G       C
On the ninethy-sixth day we sailed again
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
      C                   G       C
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
        C            C            G       F
With our cracked four-pounders, we made to fight
[Chorus]
  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold
    G       C
We'd fire no guns
G       F
Shed no tears
     C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateers
[Verse]
   C              G         C
The Yankee lay low down with gold
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
       C                 G          C
She was broad and fat and loose with stays
      C                  C        G         F
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days
[Chorus]
  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold
    G       C
We'd fire no guns
G       F
Shed no tears
     C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateers
[Verse]
       C                   G       C
Then at length we stood two cables away
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
   C                             G      C
Our cracked four-pounders made an aweful din
        C       C             G        F
But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in
[Chorus]
  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold
    G       C
We'd fire no guns
G       F
Shed no tears
     C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateers
[Verse]
   C                  G              C
The Antelope shook and pitched on her side
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
C           C              G       C
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
       C          C           G       F
And the main truck carried off both me legs
[Chorus]
  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold
    G       C
We'd fire no guns
G       F
Shed no tears
     C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateers
[Verse]
  C                 G            C
So here I lay in the twenty-third year
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
    C        C              G      C
It's been six years since we sailed away
     C         C       G     F
And I just made Halifax yesterday
[Chorus]
  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold
    G       C
We'd fire no guns
G       F
Shed no tears
     C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateers
[Outro]
(Slowly)
C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier (hold it)
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateeeeeerrrrssss (go wild on the C)

Am                                      F        C
This is the story of a very unfortunate coloured man
       E                E7       Am
Who got arrested down in old Hong Kong
Am                                   F         C
He got twenty years' privilege taken away from him
       E          E7       Am
When he kicked old Buddha's gong
G                         C
And now he's poppin' the piano just to raise the price
                              E
Of a ticket to the land of the free
        Am                  F                 C
Well, he says his home's in 'Frisco where they send the rice
        E7             Am
But it's really in Tennessee
Am             E
That's what he says
 Am
I need someone to love me
F        C       E7                       Am
Need somebody to carry me home to San Francisco
   F            C       E7
And bury my body there
 Am                        F            C        E
I need someone to lend me a fifty-dollar bill and then
          E7              Am
I'll leave Hong Kong far behind me
   F              C        E7
For happiness once again
Am
Won't somebody believe
      C               E7
I've a yen to see that Bay again
Am
Everytime I try to leave
     C                     E7
Sweet opium won't let me fly away
 Am
I need someone to love me
F        C       E7                       Am
Need somebody to carry me home to San Francisco
   F            C       E7     Am
And bury my body there

And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda
vendredi 30 juin 2017
16:40
(I prefer to play with the capo on the 2nd fret)


[Verse]

    G       C           G          Em   
When I was a young man I carried me pack
     G              D         G
And I lived the free life of a rover
                       C            G        Em  
From the Murray's green basin to the dusty Outback
 G             D        G
I waltzed my Matilda all over

       D       C             G
Then in 1915 me country said, Son
    D                                 C          G
It's time you stopped rambling there's work to be done
                 C                 G         Em
So they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun
        G            D         G
And they marched me away to the war

[Chorus]

    G                   C           G
    And the band played Waltzing Matilda
                           C           D   Dsus4  D
    When the ship pulled away from the quay
          C            Am          G          Em
    And amidst all the tears, flag-waving and cheers
       G              D      G  Gsus4  G
    We sailed off for Gallipoli

[Verse]

       G        C           G        Em
And how well I remember that terrible day
        G                 D            G
When our blood stained the sand and the water
               C              G          Em
And how in that hell that they call Suvla Bay
       G              D            G
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter

      D                       C              G
Johnny Turk he was ready, he'd primed himself well
  D                              C                G
He rained us with bullets, and he showered us with shells
                   C         G               Em
And in five minutes flat he'd blown us all to hell
      G            D            G
Nearly blew us back home to Australia

[Chorus]

    G                   C           G
    And the band played Waltzing Matilda
                       C        D   Dsus4  D
    When we stopped to bury our slain
    C         Am            G            Em
    We buried ours, and the Turks buried theirs
            G           D      G  Gsus4  G
    Then we started all over again

[Verse]

    G              C              G           Em   
And those that were left, well, we tried to survive
       G            D                G
In that mad world of blood, death and fire
                 C            G        Em  
And for ten weary weeks I kept myself alive
       G           D             G
While around me the corpses piled higher

      D                            C         G
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over head
   D                  C        G
And when I awoke in me hospital bed
                   C             G            Em
And saw what it had done, well, I wished I was dead
     G              D                 G
Never knew there was worse things than dying

[Chorus]

    G                  C           G
    So no more I'll go Waltzing Matilda
                         C            D   Dsus4  D
    All around the green bush far and near
       C             Am     G              Em
    To hump tent and pegs a man needs both legs
            G           D        G  Gsus4  G
    No more Waltzing Matilda for me

[Verse]

       G            C            G             Em   
So they gathered the wounded, the crippled, the maimed
        G               D            G
And they shipped us back home to Australia
                C            G            Em  
The armless, the legless, the blind, the insane
     G             D         G
Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla

   D                         C        G
And when the ship pulled into Circular Quay
 D                            C            G
I looked at the place where me legs used to be
                            C            G           Em
And thanked Christ there was no one there waiting for me
  G             D            G
To grieve and to mourn and to pity

[Chorus]

    G                   C           G
    And the band played Waltzing Matilda
                         C            D   Dsus4  D
    When they carried us down the gangway
        C      Am                 G               Em
    But nobody cheered, they just stood there and stared
              G                D      G  Gsus4  G
    Then they turned all their faces away

[Verse]

  G         C       G         Em   
So now every April I sit on my porch
     G            D          G
And I watch the parade pass before me
            C            G            Em  
I see my old comrades how proudly they march
 G          D              G
Renewing old dreams of past glory

       D                         C               G
And the old men march slowly, all bones stiff and sore
       D                       C         G
They're tired old heroes from a forgotten war
                    C               G             Em
And the young people ask, "What are they marching for?"
   G       D             G
And I ask myself the same question

[Chorus]

    G                  C           G
    And the band plays Waltzing Matilda
                          C          D   Dsus4  D
    And the old men still answer the call
        C          Am         G           Em
    But year after year their numbers are fewer
            G           D              G  Gsus4  G
    Someday no one will march there at all

[Verse]

G                 C
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
G                                   D
Who'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me?

And their ghosts may be heard as they march by the Billabong
C             G          D7         G
Who'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me?

[Verse 1] 

(Willie Nelson)

Bm       A                     G                Bm 
I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride
A          G      D     A
Sword and pistol by my side
Em      Bm                  A              G
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Em     Bm                A                G
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
Bm            A                G        A     D
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty five
Bm         G     A
But I am still alive

[Verse 2]

(Kris Kristofferson)

Bm       A             G            Bm 
I was a sailor, I was born upon the tide
A         G     D    A
With the sea I did abide
Em            Bm               A           G
I sailed a schooner round the horn of Mexico
Em      Bm                   A               G
I went aloft and furled the main sail in a blow
Bm            A                    G       A      D
And when the yards broke off they say that I got killed
Bm        G       A
But I am living still

[Verse 3]

(Waylon Jennings)

Bm       A                     G             Bm
I was a dam builder, across a river deep and wide
A                G     D      A
Where steel and water did collide
Em              Bm             A        G
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
Em            Bm             A              G
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
Bm           A               G          A       D
They buried me in that gray tomb that knows no sound
Bm         G     A
But I am still around

[Bridge]

(All)

                D           D/C#        Bm          A           G      D/F#
I'll always be around, and around, and around, and around, and around...
Em G A D

[Verse 4]

(Johnny Cash)

Bm           A                 G          Bm 
I'll fly a starship across the universe divide
A           G        D      A
And when I reach the other side
Em           Bm                A          G
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Em         Bm           A           G
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Bm        A           G       A      D
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
Bm     G      A
But I will remain

[Outro]

(All)
                  D         D/C#        Bm         A          G     D/F#
And I'll be back again, and again, and again, and again, and again...
Em G A D

Where Yankee boys are all the go,

Was you ever in Dundee,
There some pretty ships you'll see,

Was you ever in Merrimashee,
Where you make fast to a tree,

Was you ever in Aberdeen,
Prettiest girls you've ever seen,

Hobo s Lullaby chords
Woody Guthrie (Goebel Reeves) to the tune of Just Before The Battle Mother by George F. Root 1862

(This is Arlo Guthrie and Pete Seeger's version)

Capo I *

G C  2x

G                     C
Go to sleep you weary hobo
D                          G   (G/F G/E G/D)
Let the towns drift slowly by
G                             C
Can't you hear the steel rail humming
D                    G
That's a hobo's lullaby

G                    C
Do not think about tomorrow
D                     G
Let tomorrow come and go
 G                           C
Tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar
D                          G
Safe from all the wind and snow

G                           C
I know the police cause you trouble
D                       G
They cause trouble everywhere
G                          C
But when you die and go to heaven
D                           G
You won't find no policemen there

G                                C
I know your clothes are torn and ragged
D                        G
And your hair is turning grey
G                           C
Lift your head and smile at trouble
D                          G
You'll find happiness some day

G                        C
So go to sleep you weary hobo
D                          G
Let the towns drift slowly by
G                             C
Don't you feel the steel rail humming
D                    G
That's a hobo's lullaby

G C G  2x

G        Am       C     G                  Bm     C      G
Bows and flows of angel hair and ice cream castles in the air
           C            Am          C                     D
And feather canyons everywhere, I've looked at clouds that way.
   G        Am   C         G                  Bm     C    G
But now they only block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone.
       C        Am                  C                D  
So many things I would have done but clouds got in my way.

    G         Am          C          G
I've looked at clouds from both sides now,
    C      G         C         G
From up and down, and still somehow
    Bm      C       G
It's clouds illusions I recall.
 C                 D  Dsus4 D    G   
I really don't know clouds    at all.

G C G  2x

G         Am        C      G                 Bm     C       G
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels, the dizzy dancing way you feel
          C     Am                    C                   D 
When every fairy tale comes real; I've looked at love that way.
   G        Am    C      G                   Bm      C        G
But now it's just another show, you leave 'em laughing when you go
          C           Am                   C              D   
And if you care, don't let them know, don't give yourself away.
   
    G         Am        C          G
I've looked at love from both sides now,
    C        G         C         G
From give and take, and still somehow
    Bm      C       G
It's love's illusions I recall.
 C                 D Dsus4 D   G   
I really don't know love     at all.

G C G  2x

G         Am        C       G               Bm       C         G
Tears and fears and feeling proud to say "I love you" right out loud,
          C           Am                  C                   D
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds, I've looked at life that way.
   G       Am          C      G                         Bm         C
But now old friends are acting strange, they shake their heads, they say
    G
I've changed.
               C        Am                    C            D 
But something's lost but something's gained in living every day.

    G         Am        C          G
I've looked at life from both sides now,
    C       G         C         G
From win and lose, and still somehow
    Bm      C       G
It's life's illusions I recall.
 C                 D Dsus4 D   G  
I really don't know life     at all.

G C G  2x

    G         Am        C          G
I've looked at life from both sides now,

From win and lose, and still somehow

In ¾, very slow.

Down In The Valley
                   G                           D7
Down in the valley, the valley so low, 
                                                        G
Hang your head over, hear the winds blow. 
                                                                D7
Hear the winds blow, dear, hear the winds blow. 
                                                        G
Hang your head over, hear the winds blow.
Down in the valley, walking between, 
Telling our story, here’s what it means. 
Here’s what it means, dear, here’s what it means, 
Telling our story, here’s what it means.
Roses love sunshine, violets love dew, 
Angels in heaven know I love you; 
Know I love you, dear, know I love you, 
Angels in heaven know I love you.
Build me a castle forty feet high, 
So I can see him as he rides by; 
As he rides by, dear, as he rides by, 
So I can see him as he rides by.
Writing this letter, containing three lines, 
Answer my question, "Will you be mine?" 
"Will you be mine, dear, will you be mine," 
Answer my question, "Will you be mine?"
If you don’t love me, love whom you please, 
Throw your arms round me, give my heart ease. 
Give my heart ease, dear, give my heart ease, 
Throw your arms round me, give my heart ease.
Throw your arms round me, before it’s too late; 
Throw your arms round me, feel my heart break. 
Feel my heart break, dear, feel my heart break. 
Throw your arms round me, feel my heart break.

[Verse]

C#m
Overhead the albatross
     G#m
Hangs motionless upon the air
   F#m
And deep beneath the rolling waves
  G#
In labyrinths of coral caves
   C#m
The echo of a distant time
     G#m
Comes willowing across the sand
   F#m                                G#
And everything is green and submarine


[Chorus]

   C#
And no-one showed us to the land
   G#
And no-one knows the wheres or whys
   F#m
But something stirs and something tries
   G#              A
And starts to climb towards the light


[Instrumental]

C#m  A  C#m  A  C#m  A  E  B  C


[Verse]

C#m
Strangers passing in the street
  G#m
By chance two separate glances meet
   F#m                        G#
And I am you and what I see is me
   C#m
And do I take you by the hand
   G#m
And lead you through the land
   F#m                           G#
And help me understand the best I can


[Chorus]

   C#
And no-one calls us to move on
   G#
And no-one forces down our eyes
   F#m
And no-one speaks and no-one tries
   G#            A
And no-one flies around the sun

Cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes
 F#m                       G#
Inviting and inciting me to rise
   C#m
And through the window in the wall
    G#m
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
 F#m                               G#
A million bright ambassadors of morning


[Chorus]

   C#
And no-one sings me lullabies
   G#
And no-one makes me close my eyes
F#m
So I throw the windows wide
   G#          A
And call to you across the sky

[Intro: Lead Guitar (with percussion)]

[Verse]

F#m                                           A
Tick-ing a-way the moments that make up a dull  day;

E                                                F#m
frit-ter and waste the hours  in an off-hand way;

                                              A
Kick-ing a-round on a piece of ground--in your hometown;

E                                                       F#m
wait-ing  for some-one or some-thing to show_you the way.----

Dmaj7                              Amaj7
Tired of ly--ing in the sun--shine,stay-ing home--to watch the rain,

Dmaj7                              Amaj7                        Dmaj7
you are young and life is long,and there is time to kill to-day.

                         C#m7
And then one day,you find--ten years have got be-hind you.

Bm7                           E                              F#m
No one told you when to run....You missed the start--ing gun.


[Solo]

F#m A E F#m F#m A E F#m F#m A E F#m F#m A E F#m

Dmaj7 Amaj7 Dmaj7 Amaj7 Dmaj7 C#7 Bm7 E

[Verse]

F#m                                                    A
run and you run-to catch up with the Sun, but it's sink-ing;

E                                          F#m
rac-ing a-round to come up be--hind you a--gain.

                                                      A
The Sun is the same in a rel-a-tive way, but you're old-er,

E                                                F#m
short-er of breath, and one-day clos-er to death.

Dmaj7                              Amaj7
Ev--'ry year is get--ing short-er, nev-er seem to find the time.

Dmaj7                                 Amaj7
Plans that ei-ther come to naught, or half a page of scrib-bled lines.

Dmaj7                           C#m7                             Bm7
Hang-ing on in qui-et des--per-a---tion is the Eng-lish way. The time is gone.

Pink Floyd - Money (Waters)


[Verse]
Bm7
Money, get away.
Get a good job with more pay and you're okay.
Money, it's a gas.
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.


[Chorus]
F#m7
New car, caviar, four star daydream,
Em                          Bm7
Think I'll buy me a football team.


[Verse]
Bm7
Money, get back.
I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack.
Money, it's a hit.
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit.


[Chorus]
          F#m7                                 Em
I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
                        Bm7
And I think I need a Lear jet.


[Verse]
Bm7
Money, it's a crime.
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie.
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today.


[Chorus]
F#m7                                  Em
But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're
            Bm
giving none away.

Rhythm on a 12-string

[Intro]

[Verse 1]

C                         D/F#
So, so you think you can tell,

            Am/E                   G
Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.

                    D/F#                      C                    Am
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil,

                     G
Do you think you can tell?


[Verse 2]

                     C                   D/F#
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts,

               Am/E                  G                             D/F#
Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change,

                 C                        Am                         G
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?


[Instrumental]

Em7  G  Em7  G  Em7  A7sus4  Em7  A7sus4  G


[Verse 3]

C                               D/F#
How I wish, how I wish you were here.

          Am/E                                    G                D/F#
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,

                                 C
Running over the same old ground. What have we found?

            Am                         G
The same old fears. Wish you were here!

Pink Floyd - Jugband Blues (Barrett)


    C                             Am
It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here,
         C                       Am                           C
And I'm almost obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here.
     Am                        C
And I never knew the moon could be so big.
     Am                        C
And I never knew the moon could be so blue.
       Am                                  C
And I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes
   F                 G                A
And brought me here instead dressed in red.
       Bm        F#m          Bm           F#
And I'm wondering who could be writing this song.
G       D           A             D
I don't care if the sun don't shine.
   G       D       A          D
And I don't care if nothing is mine.
   F                   Am
And I don't care if I'm nervous with you.
F                        A
I'll do my loving in the Winter.

G  D  A  D  G  D  A  D ...  Am  C/G


       Am  C/G       Am
And the sea____ isn't green.
  C/G         Am
And I love the queen.
          C/G        A
And what exactly is a dream?
          C/G        A
And what exactly is a joke?

[Verse]


Mama,just killed a man,

Put a gun against his head, 

Pulled my trigger,now he's dead,

Mama, life had just begun,

But now I've gone and thrown it all away 

Mama ooo,

Didn't mean to make you cry 

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow

Carry on,carry on, as if nothing really matters 


[Verse]


Too late,my time has come, 

Sends shivers down my spine 

Body's aching all the time, 

Goodbye everybody-I've got to go 

Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth 

Mama ooo- (any way the wind blows) 

I don't want to die,

I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

Quand la mer monte

Am
Tout près du Cap Gris Nez, quand j'ai fini d'pécher,
                                   E7
Once s'retrouve chez Lèonce, on est onsse


On mesure les poissons en vidant des canons
                               Am
Et on passe vite le cap, car ça tape.
       C
Bientôt plus d'Cap Gris Nez encore moins d'Cap Blanc Nez,
                                      E7
Ce qu'on voit c'est nos nez tout rouge et


Quand les verres que je lève otent le sel sur mes lèvres,
                                 A
Moi, je pense à Marie qui est partie.




A            E                       A
Quand la mer monte, j'ai honte, j’ai honte
           E7          A
Quand elle descend, je l'attends,
       E                        A
A marée basse, elle est partie hélas,
       E7                A
A marée haute, avec un autre.



Lors Le nez dégrisé, je quitte l'estaminet,
Et je regarde en rêvant, le ridens,
L'autre côté de la mer, les collines d'Angleterre.
Mon Dieu qu'l'monde par ici est tout p'tit.
Et à gorge déployée sur le flot déchainé,
Je l'appelle à grands cris: "Viens Marie".
P't'ê' qu'à la  molliment, pour pêcher c'est le bon temps,
Mon filet m'la rendra dans mes bras.




Quand la mer monte, j'ai honte, j’ai honte
Quand elle descend, je l'attends,
A marée basse, elle est partie hélas,
A marée haute, avec un autre.

J'ai rencontré bien des belles dans tous les pays
De Tarascon à Bruxelles, de Nantes à Massy
Mais celle que je préfère à tous ces trésors
B                      E           B                   E
D'un amour vraiment sincère, c'est ma p'tite blonde du Nord
Elle s'appelle Françoise, c'est une Lilloise
Elle parle drôlement elle dit "Mi" pour moi
"Li" pour lui, "Ti" pour toi
Son accent m'affole, je vous donne ma parole  <- not sure sur "parole". F#7 ?
Qu'elle fait tout ce qu'elle veut d'moi ma foi, avec son patois
A vouloir parler comme elle, je me dégourdis
Pour Bouteille, j'dis boutelle, pour toujours: "Toudis"
Oh mais ce qui me désespère c'est mon imbarras
Qu'j'ai à prononcer les r; r,r,r  je n'peux pas
Elle s'appelle Françoise, c'est une Lilloise
Elle parle drôlement elle dit "Mi" pour moi
"Li" pour lui, "Ti" pour toi
Son accent m'affole, je vous donne ma parole
Qu'elle fait tout ce qu'elle veut d'moi ma foi, avec son patois
Quand nous passâmes devant l'maire, elle fait "oui", j'fais "ouais"
Neuf mois après j'étos père, ch'étot min portrait
C'est une charmante petite fille, j'l'aime éperdument
Elle est belle, elle est gentille et tout comme euss'maman
Elle s'appelle Françoise, c'est une Lilloise
Elle parle drôlement elle dit "Mi" pour moi
"Li" pour lui, "Ti" pour toi
Son accent m'affole, je vous donne ma parole
Qu'elle fait tout ce qu'elle veut d'moi ma foi, avec son patois

Verse:

   Am                               
...falcon was a pretty bird
F        G      C   E
wandered as she flew
   F       G         C      C/B Am   
She danced around and pranced around 
   E        E7         Am
wherever the warm winds blew

       Am
And the falcon was a pretty bird 
   F         G      C   E
Her voice was always still,
   F        G         C   C/B  Am
But men with drums and men with guns 
    E          E7     Am
they taught her how to kill

   Am
Her eye was on the sparrow 
   F        G      C   E
Her mind was on the dove,
   F      G         C  C/B  Am  
But no one cared and no one dared 
  E        E7     Am
to speak to her of love

   Am
Her eyes are always hooded 
   F         G        C   E
Her claws are sharp as steel
  F         G      C   C/B  Am  
We teach her not to see too much 
  E         E7      Am
We teach her not to feel

[Repeat Intro]

  Am
Go build you a log cabin 
    F    G      C   E
on a mountain so high,
   F        G         C   C/B   Am  
And hear the feathered war-birds yell 
  E        E7        Am
as she goes screaming by

      Am
She'll tease you she'll please you 
      F    G       C   E
She'll satisfy your needs
   F       G         C    C/B Am  
But someday she might turn around 
   E        E7        Am
and maul the hand that feeds

    Am
Your hours might be numbered 
    F         G    C     E    
Your end might come someday
  F         G         C   C/B  Am  
Go break her chain and free her brain 
   E        E7     Am
and send her on her way

       Am
And the falcon is a pretty bird
F       G      C   E
Wonders as she flies
   F       G    C  C/B  Am  
She asks us easy questions 
  E        E7    Am
We tell her easy lies

 C                F
No use crying, talking to a stranger,
 C                        G    G7
Naming the sorrows you've seen.
 C                  F 
Too many sad times, too many bad times,
 C          G7            C
And nobody knows what you mean.
Chorus:
   C                             F
   Ah, but if somehow you could pack up your sorrows,
   C                    G
   And give them all to me,
    C                    F
   You would lose them, I know how to use them,
    C       G7      C
   Give them all to me.
Verse 2:
 C                F
No use rambling, walking in the shadows,
 C                   G    G7
Trailing a wandering star.
 C                F 
No one beside you, no one to hide you,

Nobody knows where you are.

Looking for a spirit that's free.
 C                    F 
Too many wrong times, too many long times,
C       G7           C
Nobody knows what you see.

CHORUS

 C               F
No use roaming, lying by the roadside,
 C                   G    G7
Seeking a satisfied mind.
 C                 F 
Too many highways, too many byways,
C       G7           C
And nobody's walking behind.

Catcher In The Rye

Sammy uses some odd timings in the song, like throwing in an extra 2/4 measure between alternate verses,
but it works perfectly well in 4/4 signature.
Capo on 2 for the original on the"Song For Patty" album (it will still be off with the original if you 
try to play along due to a change in tape speed during mastering).
Capo on 3 for the version on "Sammy Walker"


Intro: G D C D x 2

G
I'm gonna catch me a ride on the subway car
      D
That's heading for the Old North Star
   C                                 G         D
And leave my troubles stranded on the mainland

G
I'm gonna crown the god of night with light
   D
And pull myself clean outta sight
   C                              D
And turn the phony world I live to sand

G
I would gladly sail away 
   D
And never mind a word you say
       C                              G       D
They're just the figments of your imagination

G
Cast your riddles at my head
D
About the way I must be fed
C                                  D
Upon your rules and schools of institutions


Chorus:

G
Why Lord why
        C
Were the mountains built so high?
       D             C
And the shoals of the Sea
             G        D
Sometimes get lonely?
G
Why Lord why
      C
Must I learn to testify?
    D
When all I want to be
         C              G
Is just a catcher in the rye?



G
It's hard to dream within a scheme
    D
That says your soul can't be redeemed
   C                                G  D
And Silent Night is heard outside my window

G 
Days are long and ways are short
   D
And nights are left with no resort 
 C                              D
Except to listen to the lonesome wind blow


Chorus:
G
Why Lord why
        C
Were the mountains built so high?
       D             C
And the shoals of the Sea
             G        D
Sometimes get lonely?
G
Why Lord why
      C
Must I learn to testify?
    D
When all I want to be
         C              G
Is just a catcher in the rye?


G
If you can't seem to find the aim
D
Of the rules set for the game
       C                             G      D
They'll throw you in a school of restitution

G
They'll look you in the eye and grin
   D
And say "I'd like to be your friend"
   C                               D
And wear a sign reads "Long Live Execution"


Chorus:
G
Why Lord why
        C
Were the mountains built so high?
       D             C
And the shoals of the Sea
             G        D
Sometimes get lonely?
G
Why Lord why
      C
Must I learn to testify?
    D
When all I want to be
         C              G
Is just a catcher in the rye?

        Am            Am/g Am/f  C/g
So it’s a long long hard way to the East Colorado Dam
                                           E7
If I make it to Saint Louis, I’ll send you a telegram
Am                 Am/g   Am/f  C/g
If I don’t make it at all, you’ll know why I didn’t call
                                 E7                Am    (G F C)
Just kiss the baby for me and come see my grave next fall


The weather’s getting warmer and the baby’s coming soon
I’ll try to find some work that might carry us through to June
But everywhere’s the same when you’re a man without a name
They’ll make you feel so useless and then wonder why you came
If a soul-searching beggar is what I was meant to be
I’d rather rock behind the walls of your penitentiary


So it’s a long long hard way to the East Colorado Dam
If I make it to Saint Louis, I’ll send you a telegram
If I don’t make it at all, you’ll know why I didn’t call
Just kiss the baby for me and come see my grave next fall


You say you love me now like you always did before
And I love just as well but I just can’t keep you down no more
So I’ll be leaving in the morning if the weather’s bad or good
And let you find a man who’ll give you all the things I never could
But I’ll never understand as long as I live
How we can talk of love our neighbor yet we can never forgive


So it’s a long long hard way to the East Colorado Dam
If I make it to Saint Louis, I’ll send you a telegram
If I don’t make it at all, you’ll know why I didn’t call
Just kiss the baby for me and come see my grave next fall

[C          F  C            F        C]
I ain't got no home in this world anymore.
I was farmin' on the shares, always I was poor;
My crops I'd lay away into the banker's store.
My wife she took down and died upon the cabin floor,
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

I ain't got no home in this world anymore.
I ain't got no home, I'm just a-ramblin' 'round,
A hard working ramblin' man, and I go from town to town.
police make it hard  wherever I may go
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

I ain't got no home in this world anymore.
Well, as I look around, it's mighty plain to see
This wide open world, she's a funny old place to be;
The gamblin' man is rich, the workin' man is poor,
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

[                                     B-C]
I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

Additional verse, not sung by Dylan:
My brothers and my sisters are stranded on this road,
A hot and dusty road that a million feet have trod;
Rich man took my home and drove me from my door
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

Verse1
------

C                   Am               F           Em
I can hear the soft breathing of the girl that I love,

      C           Dm       G
As she lies here beside me asleep with the night

       C         Am        F            Em
And her hair in a fine mist floats on my pillow

 C            Dm          F  G       C
Reflecting the glow of the winter moonlight

Betwixt each verse put fill 1 in

Verse2
------

She is soft she is warm but my heart remains heavy,
As I watch as her breasts gently rise, gently fall.
For I know with the first light of dawn I'll be leaving,
And tonight will be all I have left to recall.

Verse3

Oh what have I done, why have I done it,
                                  *wfill2*
I've committed a crime, broken the law.
For twenty five dollars and pieces of silver,
I held up and robbed a hard liquor store.

Verse4

My life seems unreal, my crime an illusion,
                                     *wfill2*
A scene badly written in which I must play.
And I know as I gaze at my young love beside me,
The morning is just a few hours away.

[Verse]

C                                                Am
I am just a poor boy, though my story's seldom told
          G
I have squandered my resistance
                     C
For a pocketful of mumbles such are promises
            Am            G                  F
All lies and jest still a man hears what he wants to hear
                   C      G    C
And disregards the rest

                                                    Am
When I left my home and family I was no more than a boy
        G
In the company of strangers
       Dm7        C
In the quiet of a railway station running scared
      Am           G                F                            C
Laying low seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go
        G              F    Em   Dm    C
Looking for the places only they would know

[Interlude]

       Am
Lie-la-lie
       G
Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie
       Am
Lie la lie
G                       F           G   C
Lie-la-lie la la la la lie la la la la lie

[Verse]

                                                Am
Asking only workmans wages I come looking for a job
               G
But I get no offers
        Dm7              C
Just a come-on from the whores on seventh avenue
       Am                 Dm7     G     F                                 C
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome I took some comfort there

Lie-la-lie la la la la lie la la la la lie

[Verse]

C
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
G7  C              Am
And wishing I was gone
      G             Dm7      G7               G  C
Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
           Am
Leading me
       G
Going Home

      C                                            Am
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
         G
And he carries the reminders
   G7               C                        Dm7     G7        C
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down or cut him 'till he cried out
                       Am
In his anger and his shame
       G              F                              C       G C  G      F      C
"I am Leaving, I am Leaving."  But the Fighter still remains

[Interlude]

       Am
Lie-la-lie

Lie-la-lie la lie-la-lie
       Am
Lie la lie
G                        F             Am
Lie-la-lie la la la la lie la la la la lie

The Sound Of Silence
dimanche 22 octobre 2017

[Verse 1]

CAPO:  6

Am                       G
Hello darkness, my old friend,
                          Am
I've come to talk with you again,
                 F     C          
Because a vision softly creeping,
        Am             F     C                  
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
        F                               C    
And the vision that was planted in my brain
      Am       
Still remains
            G       Am               
Within the sound of silence.


[Verse 2]

Am                          G         
In restless dreams I walked alone
                       Am
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
Am                 F        C
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
             Am           F        C
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
       F                                         C     
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
              Am
That split the night
               G        Am
And touched the sound of silence.


[Verse 3]

Am                         G
And in the naked light I saw
                          Am
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
Am                F       C
People talking without speaking,
Am                    F       C
People hearing without listening,
                F                       C
People writing songs that voices never share
          Am
And no one dare
            G        Am
Disturb the sound of silence.


[Verse 4]

Am                         G
Fools said I, you do not know
                     Am
Silence like a cancer grows.
Am                     F          C
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Am                    F           C
Take my arms that I might reach you.
        F                          C
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
     Am
And echoed
      G        Am
In the wells of silence


[Verse 5]

Am                        G
And the people bowed and prayed
                    Am
To the neon God they made.
Am                         F      C
And the sign flashed out its warning,
Am                     F     C
In the words that it was forming.
        Am              F
And the sign said, the words of the prophets
       F                    C
Are written on the subway walls
              Am
And tenement halls.
                     G         Am      
And whispered in the sounds of silence.

A            E             
Hello there, my old friend 
F#m                      D   
Not so long ago, it was 'till the end
A                          E            
We played out side, in the pourin' rain 
F#m                     D 
On our way up the road, we started over again
[Chorus]
F#m                  D      E
Livin' the dream, of you on top
F#m                  D      E
My mind is achin', and lord it wont stop
F#m             D7               E           A
That's how it's happened, livin' Life by the drop
[Verse]
A                             E
Up and down that road, in our worn out shoes 
F#m                            D
Talkin' 'bout good things, and singin' the blues
A                      E
You went your way, and I stayed behind
F#m                         D
We both knew, it was just a matter of time
[Chorus]
A                             E
No waste of time, we're allowed today
F#m                            D
Churnin' up the past, there's no easier way
A                             E
Times been between us, a means to an end
F#m                                   D7
God, It's good to be here, walkin' together my friend
[Bridge]
F#m                 D-0-2-2h4-2--2h4p2-0    
Livin' the dream!
F#m                 D-0-2-2h4-2--2h4p2-0
My mind stoped achin'!
F#m             D7               E           A
That's how it's happened, livin' Life by the drop

Fire in Cairo
Sunday, December 8, 2013
11:49 AM

Slowly fading blue, the eastern hollows
Catch the dying sun, night time follows
Silent and black mirror pool
Mirrors the lonely place where I meet you


See your head in the fading light
Through the dark your eyes shine bright


Burn like fire
Burn like fire in Cairo
Burn like fire
Burn like fire in Cairo


Shifting crimson veil, silken hips
Slide it under my hand, swollen lips
Whisper my name and I yearn
You take me in your arms, start to burn


F I R E I N C A I R O
F I R E I N C A I R O
F I R E I N C A I R O
Then the heat disappears and the mirage fades away


F I R E I N C A I R O
F I R E I N C A I R O
F I R E I N C A I R O
F I R E I N C A I R O


F I R E I N C A I R O
F I R E I N C A I R O
F I R E I N C A I R O
F I R E I N C A I R O


Burn like fire in Cairo, burn like a fire in Cairo
Burn like a fire fire fire fire fire
Blaze like a fire in Cairo
Blaze like fire fire fire fire fire, flare


Burn like fire
Burn like fire in Cairo

The Galway Races

    C
As I went down to Galway Town


To seek for recreation
     Am
On the seventeenth of August
  G              C
Me mind being elevated
                      G
There were passengers assembled
         Am             C
With their tickets at the station
                    Em
And me eyes began to dazzle
       Am
And they off to see the races

       C           G
With me wack fol the do fol
   Am
The diddle idle day

There were passengers from Limerick
And passengers from Nenagh
The boys of Connemara
And the Clare unmarried maiden
There were people from Cork City
Who were loyal, true and faithful
Who brought home the Fenian prisoners
From dying in foreign nations

And it's there you'll see the pipers
And the fiddlers competing
And the sporting wheel of fortune
And the four and twenty quarters
And there's others without scruple
Pelting wattles at poor Maggie
And her father well contented
And he gazing at his daughter

And it's there you'll see the jockeys
And they mounted on so stably
The pink, the blue, the orange, and green
The colors of our nation
The time it came for starting
All the horses seemed impatient
Their feet they hardly touched the ground
The speed was so amazing!

There was half a million people there
Of all denominations
The Catholic, the Protestant, the Jew, the Presbyterian
Yet there was no animosity
No matter what persuasion
But failte hospitality
Inducing fresh acquaintance

Fareweel to all our  Scottish fame
D             E      D   A
Fareweel our ancient glory
D                         A
Fareweel even to our  Scottish name
D             E     D   A
So famed in martial story
A             
Now Sark runs over the Solway sands
   A      E          A  D
And Tweed runs to the Ocean.
   A                           D

To mark where Englands province stands

     A         E           D    A
Such a parcel of rogues in a nation

What force or guile could not subdue
Through many warlike ages
Is wrought now by cowards few
For hireling traitor's wages
The English steel we could disdain
Secure in valor's station
But we`re bought and we`re sold for English gold
Such a parcel of rogues in a nation

O would 'ere I had seen the day
That treason thus could sell us
My auld grey head had lain in clay
With Bruce and loyal Wallace
But pith and power to my last hour
I'll make this declaration
That we're bought and sold for English gold
Sic a parcel of rogues in a nation.

1. I must away now; I can no longer tarry,

                    C    G                D

    this morning's tempest, I have to cross.

            G       - G7               C    G

    I must be guided        without a stumble,

    into the arms I love the most.

2. And when he came to his true love's dwelling,

                  C   G          D

    he knelt down gently, upon a stone.

                      G       - G7               C  G

    And through her window,      he's whispered lowly,

             C-G       D       G

    is my true love within at home?

 

       G            C    G                      D G

3. Wake up, wake up, love, it is thine own true lover,

                   C    G             D

    wake up, wake up, love, and let me in

               G          - G7           C   G

    For I am tired, love,        and oh so weary,

               C-G        D          G

    and more than near drenched to the skin.

            G        C G                D G

4. She's raised her u..p her down soft pillow,

                      C-G                    D

    she's raised her u...p and she's let him in.

                   p G     - G7                  C  G

    And they were locked in         eachother's arms,

                C     G        D         G

    until that long night was past and gone.

 

 

    G             C     G                   D G

5. And when that long night was past and over,

                   C     G               D

    and when the small clouds began to grow,

                  G            - G7               C   G

    he's taken her hand and        hey kissed and parted,

                        C   G        D        G

    then he saddled and mounted and away did go.

  D                        G
On Raglan Road on an autumn day,
 D       G         D
I saw her first and knew
    G                   D
That her dark hair would weave a snare,
            Bm      A
that I might one day rue
 G              D
I saw the danger and I passed,
           Bm      A
along the enchanted way,
     D                             G
and I said: 'Let grief, be a fallen leaf
      D       G      D
at the dawning of the day'

  D                      G
On Grafton Street in November,
          D        G        D
we tripped lightly along the ledge
    G                  D
Of a deep ravine, where can be seen,
            Bm        A
the worth of passion's pledge
   G                      D
The Queen of Hearts, still making tarts,
         Bm     A
and I not making hay
     D                     
Oh, I loved too much and by such,
  G        D         G       D
by such, is happiness thrown away

 D                     G
I gave her gifts of the mind,
 D            G      D
I gave her the secret signs
      G                    D
That's known to the artists who have known,
                Bm        A
the true gods of sound and stone
   G                  D
And word and tint, without stint,
          Bm       A
I gave her poems to say
        D                                G
With her own name there, and her own dark hair,
    D           G         D
like clouds over fields of May

    D                              G
On a quiet street, where old ghosts meet,
 D       G       D
I see her walking now
G              D
Away from me so hurriedly,
         Bm     A
my reason must allow
    G                D
That I had loved, not as I should,
          Bm      A
a creature made of clay
        D                
When the angel woos the clay,
    G         D            G       D
he'd lose, his wings at the dawn of day

-- arpèges très rapides ou accords --


C Am G C

With our nets and gear we're faring
C               F        C   G
On the wild and wasteful ocean.
       C            F       C                G   Am
Its out there on the deep we harvest and reap our bread
     C              F         G   C
As we hunt the bonny shoals of herring

-- le reste en arpèges normaux --

C
O it was a fine and a pleasant day
                             G
Out of Yarmouth harbour I was faring
C                          Am
As a cabinboy on a sailing lugger
C                      F         G  C
We were following  the shoals of herring


Now you're up on deck, you're G fisherman
You can swear and show G manly bearing
Take your turn on watch with the other fellows
As your hunting for the shoals of herring

Now we fished the Swarth and the Broken Bank
I was cook and I'd G quarter sharing
And I used to sleep standing on my feet
As we hunted for the shoals of herring

We left the homegrounds in the month of June
And for Canny Shiels we soon were bearing
With G hundred cran of the silver darlings
That we'd taken from the shoals of herring

In the stormy seas and the living gales
Just to earn your daily bread you're faring
From the Dover Straits to the Faroe Islands
As you're hunting for the shoals of herring

Well I earned my keep and I paid my way
And I earned the gear that I was wearing
Sailed G million miles, caught ten million fishes
We were hunting after shoals of herring

You're net rope man now, or you're on the move 
And your learing all about seG faring
That's your education scraps of navigation 
As you hunt the bonnie shoals of herring 

Night and day the sea's we are daring 
Come wind or calm or winter gales
Sweating our cold growing up growing old or dying
as you hunt the bonny schoal of herring

In Banbridge Town in the County Down

One morning last July,
      Em                  G     D
From a boreen green came a sweet colleen
       Em            D          Em
And she smiled as she passed me by.
   G                        D
She looked so sweet from her two bare feet
      Em           C         D
To the sheen of her nut brown hair.
      Em                  G        D
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook my self
      Em        D      Em
For to see I was really there.

That I met in the County Down.

Verse2:

As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head,

And I looked with a feelin' rare,
     Em                 G      D
And I says, says I, to a passer-by,
          Em            D         Em
"Who's the maid with the nut brown hair?"
  G                   D
He smiled at me and he says, says he,
           Em     C         D
"That's the gem of Ireland's crown.
     Em                    G            D
Young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann,

At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there

And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes,
       Em                        G          D
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right
     Em            D         Em
For a smile from my nut brown rose.

No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
       Em           C             D
Till my plough turns rust coloured brown.
      Em                  G        D

The Dubliners' version


Dubliners – The wild rover


    G                            C
I've been a wild rover for many a year
 G            C        D7          G
I spent all me money on whiskey and beer
   G                                    C
But now I'm returning with gold in great store
   G            C        D7            G
And I never will play the wild rover no more


chorus:
           D7           G                C     
  And it's no nay never, no nay never no more
         G             C         D7        G
  Will I play the wild rover, no never, no more


 G                                   C
I went in to an alehouse I used to frequent
     G            C       D7        G
And I told the landlady me money was spent
 G                                      C
I asked her for credit, she answered me "Nay!"
     G         C             D7       G
"Such custom as yours I could have any day!"


chorus


 G                                    C
I took out of me pocket ten sovereigns bright
       G          C           D7          G
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
   G                                       C
She said: "I have whiskeys and wines on the best!
       G            C             D7      G
And the words that I told you were only in jest!"




chorus


       G                                     C
I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done
   G           C            D7       G
And ask them to pardon their prodigal son
   G                                     C
And when they've caressed me as oftimes before
 G          C             D7       G
I never will play the wild rover no more.




chorus (x2)

The Rocky Road To Dublin
samedi 18 mars 2017
16:50
Don't forget to CAPO at the 3rd FRET to play along with the earlier
 recorded version, though I think he plays it on the 4th live these days 


                THE ROCKY ROAD TO DUBLIN
                 *** CAPO 3rd FRET ***


 Am                         Am                
In the merry month of June,  When first from home I started
 Am                          G
Left the girls of Tuam,  So sad and broken hearted
  Am                    Am
Saluted Father dear,  Kissed me darlin' Mother
 Am                         G
And drank a pint of beer,  Me grief and tears to smother
 Am                     G   Am                G
Then off to reap the corn,  Leave where I was born
  Am              G             G                 G
Cut a stout blackthorn,  To banish ghosts and goblin
 Am                G        Am              G
Bought a pair of brogues,  Rattle over the bogs
 Am               G     G                      G
Frightened all the dogs,  On the rocky road to Dublin


 Am          G           Am
One, Two, Three, Four, Five
 Am                         Am
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
 G                       Am       G     Am
And all the ways to Dublin, Whack fol la de da


 Am                     Am
When in Mullingar that night,  I rested limbs so weary
 Am                       G
Started by daylight, Me spirits bright and early
 Am                   Am
Took a drop o' pure, Keep me heart from sinking
 Am                        G
That's a paddy's cure,  Whenever he's on drinking
 Am                 G        Am             G
To see the lassie's smile,  Laughing all the while
 Am              G             G                   G
At me curious style,   Would set your heart to bubbling
 Am              G     Am        G
Asked me I was hired, Wages I required
 Am              G    G                      G
I was almost tired, On the rocky road to Dublin


 Am          G           Am
One, Two, Three, Four, Five
 Am                         Am
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
 G                       Am       G     Am
And all the ways to Dublin, Whack fol la de da


 Am                       Am
Well in Dublin next arrived,  I thought it be a pity
 Am                      G
To be so soon deprived, A view of that fine city
 Am                    Am
Then I took a stroll,  All among the quality
 Am                   G
Me bundle it was stole,  In a neat locality
 Am                 G      Am             G
Something crossed me mind,  When I looked behind
 Am             G       G                G
No bundle could I find,  Upon me stick a wobbling
 Am                 G          Am                G
Enquiring after the rogue, They said me Connacht brouge
 Am              G    G                      G
Wasn't much in vogue, On the rocky road to Dublin


 Am          G           Am
One, Two, Three, Four, Five
 Am                         Am
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
 G                       Am       G     Am
And all the ways to Dublin, Whack fol la de da


 Am                     Am
Well, From  there I got away,  Me spirits never failing
 Am                      G
Landed on the quay,  Just as the ship was sailing
 Am                    Am
Captain at me roared,  Said that no room had he
 Am                        G
When I jumped aboard,  A cabin found for Paddy
 Am             G       Am                G
Down among the pigs,  Played some hearty rigs
 Am                 G           G               G
Danced some hearty jigs,  The water round me bubblin'
 Am         G           Am               G
When off Holyhead,  I wished meself was dead
 Am          G      G                      G
Or, Better far instead,  On the rocky road to Dublin


 Am          G           Am
One, Two, Three, Four, Five
 Am                         Am
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
 G                       Am       G     Am
And all the ways to Dublin, Whack fol la de da


 Am                  Am
Well, The boys of Liverpool,  When we safely landed
 Am                       G
Called meself a fool,  I could no longer stand it
 Am                     Am
Blood began to boil,  Temper I was losing
 Am                     G
Poor ould Erins Isle,  They began abusing
 Am                 G        Am             G
Hurrah me soul says I,    Shillelagh I let fly
 Am             G     G            G
Some Galway boys were by,  Saw I was a-hollerin'
 Am                G            Am             G
Then with a loud horray,  They joined in the affray
 Am                 G     G                      G
We quickly cleared the way,  For the rocky road to Dublin


 Am          G           Am
One, Two, Three, Four, Five

Auld Triangle
samedi 18 mars 2017
16:55
[Verse 1]
G
A hungry feeling
G
Came o'er me stealing
       C         Em
And the mice were squeeling
     Am     C
In my prison cell
                G
And that auld triangle went jingle-jangle
     C       Em           D     G
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
[Verse 2]
Oh! To start the morning
The warden bawling
"Get up out of bed, you! And Clean out your cell!"
And that auld triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
[Verse 3]
Oh! the screw was peeping
And the loike was sleeping
As he lay weeping
For his girl Sal
And that auld triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
[Verse 4]
On a fine Spring evening
The loike lay dreaming
And the sea-gulls were wheeling
High above the wall
And that auld triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
[Verse 5]
Oh! the wind was sighing
And the day was dying
As the loike lay crying
In his prison cell
And that auld triangle went jingle-bloody-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
[Verse 6]
In the women's prison
There are seventy women
And I wish it was with them
That I did dwell
Then that auld triangle could go jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal

G                          G             G                     D
In a neat little town they call Belfast, apprenticed to trade I was bound
    G                       Em           C             D           G
And many's the hour of sweet happiness, I spent in that neat little town
     G                  G              G                           D
Till sad misfortune came over me, which caused me to stray from the land
     G                          Em         C           D            G
Far away from me friends and relations, betrayed by the black velvet band
G                   G           G                             D
    Her eyes they shone like diamonds, I thought her the queen of the land
             G                    Em             C         D            G
    And her hair it hung over her shoulder, tied up with a black velvet band
G                      G                       G                    D         
I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid, and a gentleman passing us by
  G                    Em                 C           D             G
I knew she meant the undoing of me, by the look in her roguish black eye
 G                            G               G                       D
A gold watch she took from his pocket, and she placed it right into me hand
       G                       Em               C           D             G
And the very first thing that I thought was, bad luck to the black velvet band
G                   G           G                             D
    Her eyes they shone like diamonds, I thought her the queen of the land
             G                    Em             C         D            G
    And her hair it hung over her shoulder, tied up with a black velvet band
G                 G            G                  D
Now before a judge and a jury, next morning I had to appear
      G                Em                  C       D      G
Oh the judge he said to me "Young man, your case is proven clear 
     G                           G                G                       D
We'll give you seven years' penal servitude, to be spent far away from the land.
    G                            Em           C          D            G
Far away from your friends and relations, betrayed by the black velvet band
G                   G           G                             D
    Her eyes they shone like diamonds, I thought her the queen of the land
             G                    Em             C         D            G
    And her hair it hung over her shoulder, tied up with a black velvet band
G                       G              G               D
So come all ye jolly young fellows, and a warning take by me
   G                       Em                C          D      G
For when you are out on the town me lads, beware of them pretty colleens
           G                    G                       G                   D
For they'll feed you with strong ale "More Yeah", until you are unable to stand
        G                       Em                      C         D            G
And the very next thing that you know me lads, is you've landed in Van Diemen's Land
G                   G           G                             D
    Her eyes they shone like diamonds, I thought her the queen of the land
             G                    Em             C         D            G
    And her hair it hung over her shoulder, tied up with a black velvet band
G                   G           G                             D
    Her eyes they shone like diamonds, I thought her the queen of the land
             G                    Em             C         D            G

Hot Asphalt
lundi 22 janvier 2018

pronounce "hot ash-falt"


    Em                             G                D
Good evening all my jolly lads, I'm glad to find you well,
          Em                            D
If you'll gather all around me now the story I will tell,
         Em                    G            D
For I've got a situation and begorrah and begob,
       Em                    D       Em
I can whisper all the weekly wage of nineteen bob.

      G                                 G
'Tis twelve months come October since I left me native home,
      Em                             D
After helping the Killarney boys to bring the harvest down.
    Em                          G                D
But now I wear the geansai and around me waist a belt.
        Em                       D         Em
I'm the gaffer of the squad that makes the hot as - phalt.

CHORUS:
             G                           G
   Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat.
              Em                           D
   And if it doesn't last forever sure I swear I'll eat me hat,
               Em                                 G            D
   Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
        Em                     D      Em
   any surface that was equal to the hot as - phalt.


The other night a copper comes and he says to me, McGuire
Would you kindly let me light me pipe down at your boiler fire?
And he planks himself right down in front, with hobnails up, till late
And says I, me decent man, you'd better go and find your bait

He ups and yells, I'm down on you, I'm up to all yer pranks
Don't I know you for a traitor from the Tipperary ranks?
Boys, I hit straight from the shoulder and I gave him such a belt
That I knocked him into the boiler full of hot as - phalt

Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot as - phalt

We quickly dragged him out again and we threw him in the tub
And with soap and warm water we began to rub and scrub
But devil the thing, it hardened and it turned him hard as stone
And with every other rub, sure you could hear the copper groan

I'm thinking, says O'Reilly, that he's lookin' like old Nick
And burn me if I am not inclined to claim him with me pick
Now, says I, it would be easier to boil him till he melts
And to stir him nice and easy in the hot as - phalt

Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot as - phalt

You may talk about yer sailor lads, ballad singers and the rest
Your shoemakers and your tailors but we please the ladies best
The only ones who know the way their flinty hearts to melt
Are the lads around the boiler making hot as - phalt

With rubbing and with scrubbing, sure I caught me death of cold
For scientific purposes, me body it was sold
In the Kelvin grove museum, me boys, I'm hangin' in me pelt
As a monument to the Irish, making hot as - phalt

Well, we laid it in a hollows and we laid it in the flat
And if it doesn't last forever, sure I swear, I'll eat me hat
Well, I've wandered up and down the world and sure I never felt
Any surface that was equal to the hot as - phalt

                    A                          B
You've found yourself a friend that knows you well
                       G
But no matter what you do
                 A         
You'll always feel as though you
            E
Tripped and fell
                    Bm   F#   A   E      Bm   F#   A   E
So steady as she goes
[Verse]
                          Bm           F#           A         E

                          Bm            F#          A         E
And your blood's depleted to the point of stable glue
                     Bm   F#   A   E
Then you'll get along
                     Bm   F#   A   E
Then you'll get along
[Chorus]
                 Bm   F#   A   E
Steady as she goes

So steady as she goes
                  G
Well here we go again
                    A                          B
You've found yourself a friend that knows you well

But no matter what you do
                 A                           E
You'll always feel as though you tripped and fell
                    Bm   F#   A   E
So steady as she goes
                 Bm   F#   A   E
Steady as she goes
[Verse]
                 Bm          F#       A       E
Settle for a world, neither up or down
                  Bm             F#        A      E
Sell it to the crowd that is gathered round
                Bm          F#       A       E
Settle for a girl, neither up or down
                  Bm             F#        A      E
Sell it to the crowd that is gathered round

Top Yourself
vendredi 6 janvier 2017
21:01

#F A E throughout for verses, 
#F E #C for the chorus

How you gonna top yourself
When there is nobody else
How you gonna do it by yourself
Cause I'm not gonna be here to help you
Yeah

Alright
How you gonna top yourself
When there is nobody else
How you gonna do it by yourself
Cause I'm not gonna he here to help you

How you gonna do it alone
When I don't pick up my phone
I'll give a dog a bone
But I'm not gonna stick around to help you

Hey
Alright

Yeah
How you gonna stop yourself
When your man stops ringing your bell
Your right between Heaven and Hell
And your gonna need the good Lord to help you

How am I gonna make you see
That this ain't no way to be
See you've been gettin' it all for free
Guess you better get yourself a sugar daddy to help you

Top yourself

Such a little girl like a spinning top mamma
But you're spinning out of control
It takes sleeping like a snake like you
To rip apart my soul
Yeah, rip apart my soul
Rip apart my soul

How you gonna rock yourself to sleep
When I give up my midnight creep girl
How you gonna get that deep
When your daddy ain't around here to do it to you

Yeah, how you gonna do it alone
When I don't pick up my phone
I'll give a dog a bone
But I'm not gonna stick around to help you
Yeah

Top yourself
Top yourself
Top yourself

NOTE: VERSES are based on the chords D, Dsus4, and Dsus2.
INTRO:  Dm  C  G   *Dsus2-h-D (Means to make a Dsus2 
                              chord and immediately
                              hammer on the high E string
                              to form a D chord.)
VERSE:
D      Dsus4        D       Dsus2   D   *Dsus2-h-D

Got shoes and money, good friends too

All the people standing by, all there in the game

Love is just a story, a story without words
C                 G              C           D
Words that always never seen and never even heard

On a 12-string

[Verse 1]
Bm     G      Bm         G
Childhood living is easy to do
Am                     C  D  G                    D     C
The things that you wanted     I bought them for you
Bm        G          Bm       G
Graceless lady you know who I am
Am                C      D G                D
You know I can't let you   slide through my hands
[Chorus]
Am   C     D G        F        C   D
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Am   C     D G        F        C
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away
[Verse 2]
Bm            G       Bm            G 
I watched you suffer a dull aching pain
Am           C    D G              D    C
Now you've decided, to show me the same
Bm             G      Bm             G
No sweeping exit or offstage lines
Am              C      D G               D
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind
[Chorus]
Am   C     D G        F        C   D
Wild Horses, couldn't drag me away
Am          C     D G        F        C
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away
[Verse 3]
Bm       G           Bm          G
I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie
Am       C       D G                    D     C
I have my freedom but I don't have much time
Bm            G        Bm           G
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried
Am           C      D G          D 
Let's do some living, after we die
[Chorus]
Am   C     D G        F        C   D
Wild Horses, couldn't drag me away
Am   C     D G        F        C
Wild wild Horses, we'll ride them some day
Am   C     D G        F        C   D
Wild Horses, couldn't drag me away
Am   C     D G        F        C

Artists: #Toby Keith 
D                               A
We got winners,  We got losers,
G                                  D                       A
Chain-smokers and boozers, We got yuppies,  We got bikers,
           G                    A
We got thirsty hitch-hikers,
              Bm                                 A         G
And the girls next store dress-up like movie stars.
                             Em         Bm         G        A         D
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I love this bar.

Same chords as above

We got cowboys, We got truckers,
Broken-hearted fools and suckers, And we got hustlers, We got fighters,
Early-birds and all-nighters,
And the veterans talk about their battle scars.
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I love this bar.

Chorus

D               Bm                        D  
I love this bar,  It's my kind of place,
       E                                                        A (let ring)
Just walkin through the front door, Puts a big smile on my face,
                 Bm                             D          G
It ain't too far,   Come as your aaaarrrrrrrreeee.
                             Em         Bm         G            A            D
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I love this bar.

I've seen short skirts, We've got high-techs,
Blue-collared boys and rednecks,
And we got lovers, Lots of lookers,
I've even seen dancing girls and hookers.
And we like to drink our beer from a mason jar.
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I love this bar. (Yes I do)
      
          D             A
Toby: I like my truck.
Crowd: I like my truck.
                                   D
Toby: And I like my girlfriend.
Crowd: I like my girlfriend.

Toby: I like to take her out to dinner, I like a movie now and then.

But I love this bar, It's my kind of place,
Just toein around the dance floor, Puts a big smile on my face,
No cover charge, Come as you are.
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I love this bar.
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I just love this old bar.

                         C             D
She said,"Hello my name is Bobby Jo,
                   G

                            C          D

                     A
And if you're up for a rodeo,
                    D
I'll put a big texas smile on your face."

I said "girls....."

CHORUS:
                    C                 D
I ain't as good as I once was
           G
I got a few years on me now
               C              D
But there was a time, back in my prime
                   G
When I could really lay it down
                C                       D
If you need some love tonight
                 G    G/B  Em
Then I might have just enough
                    C                  
I ain't as good as I once was,

I've known him since we were kids at school
                         C             D

            G
Got in a tight spot
                  C          D
Hustlin' a game of pool
                      G
With a couple of redneck boys
                     A
One great big fat biker man
                    D
I David yell across the room

"Hey buddy, how bout a helpin' hand?"

I said Dave.....

CHORUS:
                    C                 D
I ain't as good as I once was
           G
My how the years have flown
               C              D

When I could really hold my own
                C                       D
If you want to fight tonigh

I ain't as good as I once was,

G
Now, red solo cup is the best receptical
For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals
   Am
And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicals
  D                        G
If you prefer drinkin' from glass
    G
Hey, red solo cup is cheap and disposable
And in fourteen years, they are decomposable
   Am
And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable
D                      G
Freddy mac can kiss my ass
Whoo!
[Chorus]

[Verse]
G
Now, I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
           Am
'Cause when beer runs down in front of my pack
     D                          G
Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky
   G
But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admirin' at how sharply my first name is written
  Am
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hittin'
                        D                   G
When I get to hittin' on them to help me get lucky
[Chorus]

Let's have a party

Now, I've seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow
But only you, red, will do for this fellow
      Am
'Cause you are the Abbot to my Costello
   D                       G
And you are the Fruit to my Loom
G
Red solo cup, you're more than just plastic
You're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic
   Am
And believe me that I am not the least bit sarcastic
    D                 G
When I look at you and say
[Bridge]
N.C.
Red solo cup, you're not just a cup
(No! No! No! God, no! )
You're my-you're my (Friend?) friend
(Friend x3; Life-long)
Thank you for being my friend

Red solo cup
I fill you up

Let's have a party

I love you, red solo cup

Christine
Friday, December 5, 2014

Artists: #Tom Paxton 
Capo I : D Bm A
Queen Vickie used to sit upon her magic stane
Makin up governments all of her own
But they took that privilege away from the queen
And gave it to a lassie that they call Christine.
CHORUS:
With your Tooria, falderdoodle Da
Tooria Oriooria.
With your Tooria, falderdoodle Da
Tooria Oriooria.
Christine was poor when she left the school
But she made a lot of cash, she was nobody's fool
She didn't make it working on the factory floor
She went to London and became -- a model.
In London Christine did go well
With a house and a Rolls Royce all to herself
But the silly wee thing she fell in love
With Gordon-Edgecombe-Ivanov.
For she had another laud called John
He was always there when the rest had gone
He was sure he was the luckiest man alive
Till he fell into the arms of the M.I.5
M.I.5 were awful taken aback
They were nearly even gonna tell their Uncle Mac.
For here was a Tory and a rye buck Red
Fighting out the cold war in Christine's bed.
Lucky Gordon's back in the jail again
And Mac's getting thrown out at number ten
The Ministers are all in a terrible rage
And Christine's thinking of going on the stage.

Lyndon Johnson told the nation

Artists: #Tom Paxton 

Artist: Tom Paxton
Title: Lyndon Johnson told the nation

Capo on the 7th Fret for record key (I'm more confortable with capo 5 or 2 myself)

  
Am
I got a letter from L.B.J 
  Dm
It said, "This is your lucky day" 
    Am                E7            Am    E7
It's time to put your khaki trousers on
Am 
Though it may seem very queer 
     Dm
We've got no jobs to give you here 
  Am             E7          Am
So we are sending you to Vietnam 

    F              C
And Lyndon Johnson told the nation 
Dm               Am
Have no fear of escalation 
            E7           Am
I am trying everyone to please 
F                C
Though it isn't really war 
Dm                 Am
We're sending fifty thousand more
             E7                 Am    E7 
To help save Vietnam from Vietnamese 

I jumped off the old troop ship 
And sank in mud up to my hips 
I cussed until the captain called me down 
Never mind how hard it's raining 
Think of all the ground we're gaining 
Just don't take one step outside of town 

And Lyndon Johnson told the nation 
Have no fear of escalation 
I am trying everyone to please 
Though it isn't really war 
We're sending sixty thousand more 
To help save Vietnam from Vietnamese 

Every night the local gentry 
Slip out past the sleeping sentry 
They go to join the old V.C. 
In their nightly little dramas 
They put on their black pajamas 
And come lobbing mortar shells at me 

And Lyndon Johnson told the nation 
Have no fear of escalation 
I am trying everyone to please 
Though it isn't really war 
We're sending seventy thousand more 
To help save Vietnam from Vietnamese 

We go round in helicopters 
Like a bunch of big grasshoppers 
Searching for the Viet Cong in vain 
They left a note that they had gone 
They had to get down to Saigon 
Their government positions to maintain 

Well, here I sit in this rice paddy 
Wondering about Big Daddy 
And I know that Lyndon loves me so 
Yet how sadly I remember 
Way back yonder in November 
When he said I'd never have to go 

And Lyndon Johnson told the nation 
Have no fear of escalation 
I am trying everyone to please 
Though it isn't really war 
We're sending a hundred thousand more 
To help save Vietnam from the Vietnamese

My Ramblin' Boy

Performed by: Tom Paxton
Tab by: Ray Sherrell, July 2010


G        D          D7        G
He was a man and a friend always
             D                       G
He stuck with me through the hard old days
                   C
He never cared if I had no dough
           D           D7       G
We rambled round in the rain and snow.


CHORUS:
D             G       C       G
And here's to you, my ramblin' boy
             D         D7      G
May all your ramblin' bring you joy.
D             G        C        G
And here's to you, my ramblin' boy
            D     D7           G
May all your ramblin bring you joy.


In Tulsa town, we chanced to stray

we thought we'd try to work one day

The boss says had room for one

says my old pal, we'd rather bum.


REPEAT CHORUS:


Late one night in a hobo camp

the weather it was cold and damp

He got the chills and he got 'em bad.

They took the only freind I had


REPEAT CHORUS:


He left me here, to ramble on

My old pal is dead and gone

If when we die, we go somewhere

I bet you a dollar, he's ramblin there. 


REPEAT CHORUS:

     Dm
Well, I used to wake
   F
and run with the moon
 G
I lived like a rake and a young man
 Dm
I covered my lovers
    F
with flowers and wounds
  G                          Dm
my laughter the devil would frighten.

   F              G
The sun, she would come
   F            Dm
and beat me back down
   C                       Dm
but every cruel day had its nightfall
   F           G
I'd welcome the stars
    F            Dm
with wine and guitars
C                      Dm
   full of fire and forgetful


Dm
My body was sharp
F
the dark air clean
   G                 Dm
and outrage my joyful companion
   Dm
whisperin' women
   F
how sweet did they seem
G                     Dm
kneelin' for me to command them


F                 G
And time was like water
   F         Dm
but I was the sea
 C                        Dm
I wouldn't have noticed it passing
      F          G
except for the turnin'
  F          Dm
of night into day
   C                   Dm
and turnin' of day into cursin'


Dm
You look at me now
   F                   Dm
and don't think I don't know
    C                      Dm
what all of your eyes are a sayin'
       Dm
Does he want us to believe
F
these ravings and lies
G                                           Dm
they're just tricks that his brain's been a playin'?


F            G
A lover of women
F               Dm
he can't hardly stand
  C                           Dm
he trembles he's bent and he's broken
    F           G
I've fallen it's true

but I say unto you
C                                  Dm
hold your tongues until after I've spoken


Dm
I was takin' by pride
F
in the pleasures I'd known
 G                          Dm
I laughed and said I'd be forgiven

but my laughter turned 'round
F                Dm
eyes blazin' and said
G                          Dm
my friend, we're holding a wedding


F           G
I buried my face
F                 Dm
but it spoke once again
C                       Dm
night to the day we're a bindin'
   F            Dm
and now the dark air
       F          Dm
is like fire on my skin
C                         Dm
and even the moonlight is blinding

Waitin' Around To Die
mardi 23 janvier 2018
16:28
Capo 4 (Chords relative to capo)
Am                                     Dm
Sometimes I don't know where this dirty road is taking me
   Am                                Em
Sometimes I don't even know the reason why
 Am
I guess I'll keep a'gambling
       Dm
Lots of booze and lots of rambling
    Am                Em               Am
It's easier than just a-waitin' around to die
Am                          Dm
One-time friends I had a ma, I even had a pa
   Am                                 Em
He beat her with a belt once cause she cried
 Am
She told him to take care of me
       Dm
She headed down to Tennessee
     Am               Em                 Am
It's easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die
Am                                     Dm
I came of age and found a girl in a Tuscaloosa bar
   Am                                Em
She cleaned me out and hit it on the sly
 Am
I tried to kill the pain
       Dm
I bought some wine and hopped a train
    Am                Em               Am
Seemed easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die
Am                                     Dm
A friend said he knew where some easy money was
   Am                                Em
We robbed a man and brother did we fly
 Am
The posse caught up with me
       Dm
Drug me back to Muskogee
    Am                Em               Am
It's two long years, just a-waitin' 'round to die
Am                                     Dm
Now I'm out of prison, I got me a friend at last
   Am                                Em
He don't steal or cheat or drink or lie
 Am
His name's codeine
       Dm
He's the nicest thing I've seen
    Am                Em               Am
Together we're gonna wait around and die






 This Land is Your Land
vendredi 6 janvier 2017
21:13
[Chorus]
G                       D
This land is your land, this land is my land 
        A                      D
From California to the New York Island
                G                         D 
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Verse]
G                      D
As I went walking that ribbon of highway
      A                    D
I saw above me that endless skyway
       G                  D  
I saw below me that golden valley
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Chorus]
G                       D
This land is your land, this land is my land 
        A                      D
From California to the New York Island
                G                         D 
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.

[Verse 2]
G                         D
I roamed and I rambled and I followed my footsteps
                A                    D 
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
          G                    D 
While all around me a voice was sounding
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Chorus]
G                       D
This land is your land, this land is my land 
        A                      D
From California to the New York Island
                G                         D 
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Verse 3]
G                  D
When the sun came shining, and I was strolling
                    A                          D 
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
           G                        D 
A voice was chanting, As the fog was lifting,
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Chorus]
G                       D
This land is your land, this land is my land 
        A                      D
From California to the New York Island
                G                         D 
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Verse 4]
G                    D
As I went walking I saw a sign there
                  A            D 
And on the sign it said "No Trespassing."
          G                        D 
But on the other side it didn't say nothing,
A                              D 
That side was made for you and me.
[Chorus]
G                       D
This land is your land, this land is my land 
        A                      D
From California to the New York Island
                G                         D 
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Verse 5]
G                        D
In the squares of the city, In the shadow of a steeple;
             A                   D 
By the relief office, I'd seen my people.
                   G                     D 
As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking,
A                             D 
Is this land made for you and me?
[Chorus]
G                       D
This land is your land, this land is my land 
        A                      D
From California to the New York Island
                G                         D 
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Verse 6]
G                    D
Nobody living can ever stop me,
       A                    D 
As I go walking that freedom highway;
      G          D
Nobody living can make me turn back
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
[Chorus]
G                       D
This land is your land, this land is my land 
        A                      D
From California to the New York Island
                G                         D 
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.
G                       D
This land is your land, this land is my land 
        A                      D
From California to the New York Island
                G                         D 
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
A                              D 
This land was made for you and me.

[Intro] D     A     Em     G   ( x2 )


[Couplet 1]

D                    A
Y'a un mariole, il a au moins quatre ans
Em                       G
Y veut t'piquer ta pelle et ton seau
D                          A
Ta couche culotte avec tes bombecs dedans
Em                                    G             D      A   Em   G
Lolita défends toi, fous-y un coup d'rateau dans l'dos.


[Couplet 2]

D                         A
Attends un peu avant d'te faire emmerder
Em                        G
Par ces p'tits machos qui pensent qu'a une chose
D                    A
Jouer au docteur non conventionné
Em                        G
J'y ai joué aussi, je sais de quoi j'cause.


[Couplet 3]

D                               A
J'les connais bien les playboys des bacs a sable
Em                             G
J'draguais leurs mères avant d'connaitre la tienne
D                              A
Si tu les écoutent, y t'f'ront porter leurs cartables
Em                                G
'reus'ment qu'j'suis la que j'te r'garde et que j't'aime.

D    Am
Lola
Em                         G                   D     Am
J'suis qu'un fantome quand tu vas ou j'suis pas
Em                     G              D       Am   Em    G
Tu sais ma mome que j'suis morgan de toi.


[Couplet 4]

Comme j'en avais marre de m'faire tatouer des machins
Qui m'font comme une bande dessinée sur la peau
J'ai écrit ton nom avec des clous dorés un par un
Plantés dans l'cuir de mon blouson dans l'dos.


[Couplet 5]

T'es la seule gonzesse que j'peux t'nir dans mes bras
Sans m'demettre une épaule, sans plier sous ton poids
Tu pèse moins lourd, qu'un moineau qui mange pas
Déploie jamais tes ailes, Lolita t'envole pas.


[Couplet 6]

Avec tes miches de rat qu'on dirait des noisettes
Et ta peau plus sucrée qu'un pain au chocolat
Tu risques de donner faim a un tas de petits mecs
Quand t'iras a l'école si jamais t'y vas


[Refrain]

D    Am
Lola
Em                         G                   D     Am
J'suis qu'un fantome quand tu vas ou j'suis pas
Em                     G              D       Am     Em    G
Tu sais ma mome que j'suis morgan de toi.


[Couplet 7]

Qu'es-tu racontes ? Tu veux un petit frangin ?
Tu veux qu'j'tachetes un ami pierrot ?
Eh ! les bébés ca s'trouve pas dans les magasins et j'crois pas
Que ta mere voudra qu'j'lui fasse un petit dans l'dos.


[Couplet 8]

Ben quoi Lola, on est pas bien ensemble ?
Tu crois pas qu'on est déjà bien assez nombreux ?
T'entends pas c'bruit, c'est le monde qui tremble
Sous les cris des enfants qui sont malheureux.


[Couplet 9]

Allez viens avec moi j'tembarque dans ma galère
Dans mon arche, y'a d'la place pour tous les marmots
Avant qu'ce monde devienne un grand cimetière
Faut profiter un peu du vent qu'on a dans le dos.


[Refrain]

D    Am
Lola
Em                         G                   D     Am

Em                     G              D       Am     Em    G
Tu sais ma mome que j'suis morgan de toi.

Intro

Sai benissimo
che sto tremando e non c'? freddo
e sono vittima
di questa gioia immensa
sai benissimo
che nulla pu? scalfirci adesso
è così fragile
il mondo che ci aspetta,
che ci spaventa.
Vorrei tentare
Vorrei offrirti le mie mani
vorrei tentare
vorrei difendere questo momento
vorrei tentare
vorrei difendere questo momento
e penso di sentirmi
confusa e felice
e penso di sentirmi
confusa e felice
e penso di sentirmi
C#m          A
confusa e felice
C#m          A
confusa e felice
C#m          A
confusa e felice

Sai benissimo
che una goccia inonda il cielo
? cos? piccolo
il mondo che ci osserva.
