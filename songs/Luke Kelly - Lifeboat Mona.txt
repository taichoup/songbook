[Chorus]
  Am        Am     G     Am
Remember December fifty-nine
    Am       Am           G       E
The howling wind and the driving rain
  Am          Am      G       C
Remember the gallant men who drowned
        G         Em   E       Am
On the lifeboat, Mona was her name.
 
 
[Verse 1]
     Am                   G       Am
The wind it blow and the sea rose up
 Am                 G      E
Beat the land with mighty waves
      Am                G         C
At St Andrew's Bay the lightship fought
     G    Em       E        Am
The sea until her moorings gave.

On the lifeboat, Mona was her name.

    Am                G      Am
The captain signalled to the shore
    Am                G        E
"We must have help or we'll go down"
     Am                G     C
From Broughty Ferry at two A.M.
     G        Em   E      Am
They sent the lifeboat Mona.

Eight men formed that gallant crew
     Am               G         E
They set their boat against the main
    Am                     G         C
The wind's so hard and the sea's so rough
       G        Em      E      Am
We'll never see land or home again.
 
 
[Chorus]

  Am          Am      G       C
Remember the gallant men who drowned
        G         Em   E       Am
On the lifeboat, Mona was her name.
 
 
[Verse 4]
      Am                    G    Am
Three hours went by and the Mona called
    Am                       G        E
The wind blows hard and the sea runs high
       Am          G        C
In the morning on Carnusty beach
    G    Em       E       Am
The Mona and her crew did lie.

On the lifeboat, Mona was her name.
 
 
[Verse 5]
 Am                     G     Am
Five lay drowned in the cabin there
Am                 G       E
Two were washed up on the shore
 Am                      G       C
Eight men died when the boat capsized
         G         Em     E     Am
and the eighth is lost forever more.

The howling wind and the driving rain
    Am                 G      C
The men who leave the land behind
        G       Em         E     Am
and the men who never see land again.

The men who leave the land behind
        G       Em         E     Am
and the men who never see land again.
