[Verse]

G5                F5         Bb5
 Where do bad folks go when they die
G5                     C~              Bb5
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
G5              F5       Bb5
Go to a lake of fire and fry
C5                    F5        G5
See 'em again till the Fourth of July

[Chorus]

Dm              Bb/F
I knew a lady  Came from Duluth
D5  Dm
Bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
   Dm                     Bb/F
She went to her grave just a little too soon
C5/G                      D5/A   Dm
Flew and laid down on the yellow moon

Dm              Bb/F
People cry  People moan
D5  Dm
Look for a dry place to call their home
   Dm                     Bb/F
Try to find some place to rest their bones
C5/G                      D5/A   Dm
While the angels and the devils try to make their own
