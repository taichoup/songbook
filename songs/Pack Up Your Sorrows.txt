Verse 1:
 C                F
No use crying, talking to a stranger,
 C                        G    G7
Naming the sorrows you've seen.
 C                  F 
Too many sad times, too many bad times,
 C          G7            C
And nobody knows what you mean.
Chorus:
   C                             F
   Ah, but if somehow you could pack up your sorrows,
   C                    G
   And give them all to me,
    C                    F
   You would lose them, I know how to use them,
    C       G7      C
   Give them all to me.
Verse 2:
 C                F
No use rambling, walking in the shadows,
 C                   G    G7
Trailing a wandering star.
 C                F 
No one beside you, no one to hide you,
C       G7           C
Nobody knows where you are.

CHORUS

Verse 3:
 C                F
No use gambling, running in the darkness,
 C                          G    G7
Looking for a spirit that's free.
 C                    F 
Too many wrong times, too many long times,
C       G7           C
Nobody knows what you see.

CHORUS

Verse 4:
 C               F
No use roaming, lying by the roadside,
 C                   G    G7
Seeking a satisfied mind.
 C                 F 
Too many highways, too many byways,
C       G7           C
And nobody's walking behind.
