Am                                      F        C
This is the story of a very unfortunate coloured man
       E                E7       Am
Who got arrested down in old Hong Kong
Am                                   F         C
He got twenty years' privilege taken away from him
       E          E7       Am
When he kicked old Buddha's gong
G                         C
And now he's poppin' the piano just to raise the price
                              E
Of a ticket to the land of the free
        Am                  F                 C
Well, he says his home's in 'Frisco where they send the rice
        E7             Am
But it's really in Tennessee
Am             E
That's what he says
 Am
I need someone to love me
F        C       E7                       Am
Need somebody to carry me home to San Francisco
   F            C       E7
And bury my body there
 Am                        F            C        E
I need someone to lend me a fifty-dollar bill and then
          E7              Am
I'll leave Hong Kong far behind me
   F              C        E7
For happiness once again
Am
Won't somebody believe
      C               E7
I've a yen to see that Bay again
Am
Everytime I try to leave
     C                     E7
Sweet opium won't let me fly away
 Am
I need someone to love me
F        C       E7                       Am
Need somebody to carry me home to San Francisco
   F            C       E7     Am
And bury my body there
