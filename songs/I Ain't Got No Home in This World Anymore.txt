Woody Guthrie - I Ain't Got No Home in This World Anymore

C                   F                          C
I ain't got no home, I'm just a-ramblin' 'round,
C                                  D               G
A hard working ramblin' man, and I go from town to town.
C                   F
police make it hard  wherever I may go
   C                           G        C
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

[C          F  C            F        C]
I ain't got no home in this world anymore.
I was farmin' on the shares, always I was poor;
My crops I'd lay away into the banker's store.
My wife she took down and died upon the cabin floor,
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

I ain't got no home in this world anymore.
I ain't got no home, I'm just a-ramblin' 'round,
A hard working ramblin' man, and I go from town to town.
police make it hard  wherever I may go
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

I ain't got no home in this world anymore.
Well, as I look around, it's mighty plain to see
This wide open world, she's a funny old place to be;
The gamblin' man is rich, the workin' man is poor,
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

[                                     B-C]
I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

Additional verse, not sung by Dylan:
My brothers and my sisters are stranded on this road,
A hot and dusty road that a million feet have trod;
Rich man took my home and drove me from my door
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.
