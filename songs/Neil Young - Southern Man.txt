Neil Young - Southern Man

[Intro]

| Dm       | Bb  Gm    | Dm       | Bb  Gm    |


[Chorus]

Dm                 Fmaj7/C
Southern man, better keep your head,
Bb                    G7
don't forget what your Good Book says.
Dm                 Fmaj7/C
Southern change gonna come at last,
Bb                  G7             Dm
now your crosses are burnin' fast, southern man.

| Bb  Gm    | Dm       | Bb  Gm    |


[Verse 1]

Dm              Bb       Gm
I saw cotton and I saw black,
Dm                     Bb            Gm
tall white mansions and little shacks;
Dm                        Bb          Gm
southern man when will you pay them back?
A
I heard screamin' and bull whips crackin'.

How long, how long? Ah!

| Dm       | Bb  Gm    | Dm       | Bb  Gm    |


[Chorus]

Dm                 Fmaj7/C
Southern man, better keep your head,
Bb                    G7
don't forget what your Good Book says.
Dm                 Fmaj7/C
Southern change gonna come at last,
Bb                  G7             Dm
now your crosses are burnin' fast, southern man.

| Bb  Gm    | Dm       | Bb  Gm    |


[Verse 2]

Dm              Bb       Gm
I saw cotton and I saw black,
Dm                     Bb            Gm
tall white mansions and little shacks;
Dm                        Bb          Gm
southern man when will you pay them back?
A
I heard screamin' and bull whips crackin'.

How long, how long? Ah!
