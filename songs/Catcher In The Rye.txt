Sammy uses some odd timings in the song, like throwing in an extra 2/4 measure between alternate verses,
but it works perfectly well in 4/4 signature.
Capo on 2 for the original on the"Song For Patty" album (it will still be off with the original if you 
try to play along due to a change in tape speed during mastering).
Capo on 3 for the version on "Sammy Walker"


Intro: G D C D x 2

G
I'm gonna catch me a ride on the subway car
      D
That's heading for the Old North Star
   C                                 G         D
And leave my troubles stranded on the mainland

G
I'm gonna crown the god of night with light
   D
And pull myself clean outta sight
   C                              D
And turn the phony world I live to sand

G
I would gladly sail away 
   D
And never mind a word you say
       C                              G       D
They're just the figments of your imagination

G
Cast your riddles at my head
D
About the way I must be fed
C                                  D
Upon your rules and schools of institutions


Chorus:

G
Why Lord why
        C
Were the mountains built so high?
       D             C
And the shoals of the Sea
             G        D
Sometimes get lonely?
G
Why Lord why
      C
Must I learn to testify?
    D
When all I want to be
         C              G
Is just a catcher in the rye?



G
It's hard to dream within a scheme
    D
That says your soul can't be redeemed
   C                                G  D
And Silent Night is heard outside my window

G 
Days are long and ways are short
   D
And nights are left with no resort 
 C                              D
Except to listen to the lonesome wind blow


Chorus:
G
Why Lord why
        C
Were the mountains built so high?
       D             C
And the shoals of the Sea
             G        D
Sometimes get lonely?
G
Why Lord why
      C
Must I learn to testify?
    D
When all I want to be
         C              G
Is just a catcher in the rye?


G
If you can't seem to find the aim
D
Of the rules set for the game
       C                             G      D
They'll throw you in a school of restitution

G
They'll look you in the eye and grin
   D
And say "I'd like to be your friend"
   C                               D
And wear a sign reads "Long Live Execution"


Chorus:
G
Why Lord why
        C
Were the mountains built so high?
       D             C
And the shoals of the Sea
             G        D
Sometimes get lonely?
G
Why Lord why
      C
Must I learn to testify?
    D
When all I want to be
         C              G
Is just a catcher in the rye?
