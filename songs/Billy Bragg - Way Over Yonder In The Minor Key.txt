Capo on 4
 
 
[Intro]
G   C   C    G
 
 
[Verse 1]
G                              C
I lived in a place called Okfu skee
C                                   G
And I had a little girl in a holler tree
G                                  C
I said, little girl, it's plain to see
C                               G
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
D                              Em
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
 
Hold the Em and he does this little hammer on after each verse and chorus:

B|--------------0------------------------------|
G|-----0--------0------------------------------|
D|-----2----0h2--------------------------------|
A|-----2----2----------------------------------|
E|--0------------------------------------------|
 
[Verse 2]
G                            C
She said it's hard for me to see
C                           G
How one little boy got so ugly
G                              C
Yes my little girly that might be
C                                         G
But there ain't nobody that can sing like me
D                               Em
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
 
[Chorus]
C                            G
Way over yonder in the minor key
Am                           G
Way over yonder in the minor key
D                                     Em
There ain't nobody that can sing like me
 
[Verse 3]
G                             C
We walked down by the Buckeye Creek
C                                  G
To see the frog eat the goggle-eye bee
G                                    C
To hear the west wind whistle to the east
C                                     G
There ain't nobody that can sing like me
D                               Em
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
 
G                             C
Oh my little girly will you let me see
C                                    G
Way over yonder where the wind blows free
G                             C
Nobody can see in our holler tree
C                                  G
And there ain't nobody that can sing like me
D                               Em
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
 
[Chorus]
C                            G
Way over yonder in the minor key
Am                          G
Way over yonder in the minor key
D                               Em
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
 
[Interlude]
C     G    Am    G     D     Em
(Played like the chorus)
 
[Verse 4]
G                                   C
Her mama cut a switch from a cherry tree
C                          G
And laid it on the she and me
G                                  C
It stung lots worse than a hive of bees
C                                         G
But there ain't nobody that can sing like me
D                               Em
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
 
G                             C
Now I have walked a long long ways
C                                      G
And I still look back to my Tanglewood days
G                                    C
I've led lots of girls since then to stray
C                                      G
Saying ain't nobody that can sing like me
D                               Em
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
 
[Chorus]
C                            G
Way over yonder in the minor key
Am                           G
Way over yonder in the minor key
D                              G
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
D                               Em
Ain't nobody that can sing like me
