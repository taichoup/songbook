Neil Young - Down By The River

[Intro]



Em7  A  Em7  A





[Verse]



Em7                 A                      Em7

Be on my side, I'll be on your side, baby,

                        A           Em7

there is no reason for you to hide.

                   A                       Em7

It's so hard for me stay'in here all alone

                           A         Cmaj7

when you could be takin' me for a ride,





[Pre-Chorus]



    Bm

yeah, yeah.

Cmaj7            Bm                C

She could drag me over the rainbow

               Bm  D  G

and send me away.





[Chorus]



     D         A  G

Down by the river,

   D        A  G

I shot my baby.

     D         A

Down by the river,



Em7  A  Em7            A

dead, ooh, shot her dead.



Em7  A  Em7  A





[Verse]



You take my hand, I'll take your hand,

together we may get away.

This much madness is too much sorrow,

it's impossible to make it today,





[Pre-Chorus]



  yeah, ooh, ooh, yeah.

She could drag me over the rainbow

and send me away.





[Chorus]



Down by the river,

I shot my baby.

Down by the river,



dead, dead, woh, woh, shot her dead,

shot her dead.





[Verse]



Be on my side, I'll be on your side, baby,

there is no reason for you to hide.

It's so hard for me stay'in here all alone

when you could be takin' me for a ride,





[Pre-Chorus]



yeah, yeah.

She could drag me over the rainbow

and send me away.





[Chorus]



Down by the river,

I shot my baby.

Down by the river,
