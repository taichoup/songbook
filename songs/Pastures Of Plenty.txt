Am
It's a mighty hard row that my poor hands have hoed
  C                                   E
My poor feet have traveled a hot dusty road
Am
Out of your Dust Bowl and Westward we rolled
                                  G              Am
And your deserts were hot and your mountains were cold


I worked in your orchards of peaches and prunes
I slept on the ground in the light of the moon
On the edge of the city you'll see us and then
We come with the dust and we go with the wind


California, Arizona, I harvest your crops
Well its North up to Oregon to gather your hops
Dig the beets from your ground, cut the grapes from your vine
To set on your table your light sparkling wine


Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground
From the Grand Coulee Dam where the waters run down
Every state in the Union us migrants have been
We'll work in this fight and we'll fight till we win


It's always we rambled, that river and I
All along your green valley, I will work till I die
My land I'll defend with my life if it be
Cause my pastures of plenty must always be free

Finger picking please, rough picking guide:

  C            G            Am            Em  

e|-------------------------------------------------(0)-----------------------|

C              G             Am      Em
Raindrops like bullets on my fragile skin
       C               G       Am       Em
And the securities I've had are creeping within
       C  G                    Am             Em 
Now I'm 20 miles outside of the place that you live
     C             G               Am             Em   
And I need one more chance now that time's running thin
Em 

C                G           Am         Em           
Well you are the things that make up my dreams
        C           G         Am            Em  
And I've spent every dime that jingles in my jeans
C               G            Am            Em  
I deserve every stone that's thrown out at me
     C             G             Am             Em 
And I think of your smile, I'm in love with your teeth
Em

C               G        Am         Em 
I'm losin' when I am not playin' no games
    C                 G           Am        Em     
Now, would you take me back when I gamble my pain?
C          G                 Am          Em
I've got no direction without her little fingers
C            G           Am                    Em
Barbed wire, razor wire, nothing keeps me from her

C               G          Am               Em 
Now if I had no boots, I'd trek through the mud
     C             G         Am             Em 
While mosquitos are racing to draw the first blood
C         G                      Am          Em  
If you're runnin' away, then I'm lookin' for you
      C                G        Am         Em  
And if you've lost your way, I'm seein' you through.
