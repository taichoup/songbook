Hamish Imlach - The Tall Tale

(actually written by one Watt Nicoll, but this is Hamish Imlach's arrangement and interpretation)

This is a sad story about a man... His wife made him give up his hobby, which was collecting bottles of whisky.
10 bottles [...]
She made him promise to throw them all down the sink. He's sitting there in the cludgie.

Instrumental, with fiddle and mandolin. Spoken intro above.

E                                                 A
Took the cork from the first bottle, had a little drink,
E                            G                  D
Kissed the bottle tenderly & poured it down the sink.
E                                      D
I uncorked the second, did the same as before.
E                                   B              E
Before I poured it down the sink, I drank a little more.
G                         D              A        
Uncorked the third, and I drank a little toast
E                                  G                D
To the losing of the ten friends I really liked the most.
E                                      D
Stood to attention, had another little drink,
        E                          B               E
Put the cork in the bucket and the whisky down the sink.

" ha ha ha! Aaaah, three done! Seven to go :D That's the truth. That's the truth what they say about whiskey, it improves with age. 

The older I'm getting, the more I like it!"

Then back to E major.

E                                                 A
The next three bottles, they were very quickly swilled.
E                            G            D
I uncorked and drained each, only drank a gill.
E                                                 D
The next bottle baulked me, for the cork was very tight,
E                                             B              E
And the room was going round and round, which didn't help me plight.
G                                 D                 A    
I fought to gain me balance as I leaned against the wall,
E                                     G               D
But I couldn't draw the room from the damned sink at all.
E                                      D
When at last I drew it, with a mighty plop,
E                        B               E
Fell on me arse, and I drank a glass of cork.

In case your're wondering what that bloody noise is
It's my alcoholic friends from next door, nodding  ????
Wine is amok ... ??? 

back to E major

E                                                        A
Well, the next sink was different, for the cork was very slack.
E                                  G            D
I held the room in one hand, and I knocked the bugger back.
E                                                     D
I tried to count the empties as they dances before me eyes,
E                                      B              E
And I'd only got to twenty-three, when much to my surprise,
G                                 D           A    
There were ten sinks of whisky, every one uncorked,
E                                  G          D
And the drain in the bottle it was very badly blocked.
E                                             D
And then I heard me wife as upon the door she knocked,
E                        B               E
Fell in the bathtub and drank the bloody lot.
