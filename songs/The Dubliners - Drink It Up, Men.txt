The Dubliners - Drink It Up, Men


Closing time for pubs in Ireland is 11:00pm. Guinness porter, commonly known as "stout", is a thick, dark brew that is consumed
in prodigious quantities throughout the country. Lord Iveagh (pronounced "ivy") is the owner of the brewery and wealthy beneficiary
of a nation's thirst.

Capo I, 3/4 time. Probably works fairly well with a banjo too


[Verse 1]
C                                      F        C
At the pub at the crossroads there's whiskey and beer
C                                      G       C
There's brandy, strong cognac that's aging for years
C                                   F         C
But for killing the thirst and for easing the gout
C                            G
There's nothing at all beats a pint of good stout
 
[Chorus (everyone sings)]
C                     G        C
Drink it up men it's long after ten
 
[Verse 2]
C                           F          C
At the pub on the crossroads I first went astray
C                                G          C
There I drank enough drink for to fill Galway Bay
C                           F         C
Going up in the morning I wore out me shoes
C                           G
Going up to the cross for the best of good booze
 
 
[Chorus]
     C              G       C
Drink it up men it's long after ten
 
 
[Verse 3]
C                             F       C
Some folk's o'er the water think bitter is fine
C                             G          C
And others the swear by the juice of the vine  
C                                            F            C
But there's nothing that's squeezed from the grape or the hop
C                                 G
Like the black liquidation with the froth on the top
 
 
[Chorus]
           C       G        C
Drink it up men it's long after ten
 
 
[Verse 4]
C                              F        C
I've travelled in England, I've travelled in France
      C                          G            C
At the sound of good music I'll sing or I'll dance
C                        F         C
So hear me then mister and pour me one more
C                               G
If I can't drink it up, then throw me out the door
 
 
[Chorus]
C                   G       C
Drink it up men it's long after ten
 
 
[Verse 5]
C                            F         C
It's Guinness's porter that has me this way
C                                     G           C
For it's sweeter than buttermilk and stronger then tea
C                          F          C
And when in the morning I feel kind a rough
 
N.C.
Me curse on lord Iveagh who brews the damn stuff
 
 
[Chorus]
C                 G         C
Drink it up men it's long after ten
C                  G        C
Drink it up men it's long after ten
