Belle & Sebastian - The Boy With The Arab Strap


[Intro]

G

[Verse 1]

G
A mile and a half on a bus takes a long time, The odour of old prison food 
                    C 
takes a long time to pass you by
G
Day upon day of this wandering gets you down, nobody gives you a chance or a 
         C
dollar in this old town
G
Hovering silence from you is a giveaway, squalor and smoke's not your style
                        C
I don't like this place, We better go
G                                                                            
Then I compare notes with your older sister, I am a lazy get, she is as pure 
      C
as the cold driven snow
D

[Verse 2]

G
What did you learn from your time in the solitary cell of your mind?
                                   C
There was noises, distractions from anything good and the old prison food
G
Colour my life with the chaos of trouble
G
Cause anything's better than posh isolation, I missed the bus, You were laid
on your back
                          D
With the boy with the arab strap
                          G
With the boy from the arab strap

[Verse 3]

G
It's something to speak of the way you are feeling to crowds there assembled
                         C
Do you ever feel you have gone too far?
G
Everyone suffers in silence a burden, the man who drives minicabs down in Old Compton
   C                                                   D
The Asian man With his love/hate affair with his racist clientele
 G
A central location for you is a must as you stagger about making free with 
             C
your lewd and lascivious boasts
  G
We all know you are soft because we've all seen you dancing
                                                         C
We know you are hard because we all saw you drinking from noon until noon again
                              D
You're the boy with the filthy laugh
                            G
You're the boy with the arab strap

[Verse 4]

G
Strapped to the table with suits from the shelter shop
                                        C  
Comic celebrity takes a back seat as the cigarette catches and sets off the smoke alarm
G
What do you make of the cool set in London?
                                                  C
You're constantly updating your hit parade of your ten biggest wanks
                              D
She's a waitress and she's got style
                                  G
Sunday bathtime could take a while
