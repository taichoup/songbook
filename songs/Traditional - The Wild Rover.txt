Traditional - The Wild Rover

(As sung by The Dubliners)

    G                            C
I've been a wild rover for many a year
 G            C        D7          G
I spent all me money on whiskey and beer
   G                                    C
But now I'm returning with gold in great store
   G            C        D7            G
And I never will play the wild rover no more


chorus:
           D7           G                C     
  And it's no nay never, no nay never no more
         G             C         D7        G
  Will I play the wild rover, no never, no more


 G                                   C
I went in to an alehouse I used to frequent
     G            C       D7        G
And I told the landlady me money was spent
 G                                      C
I asked her for credit, she answered me "Nay!"
     G         C             D7       G
"Such custom as yours I could have any day!"


chorus


 G                                    C
I took out of me pocket ten sovereigns bright
       G          C           D7          G
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight
   G                                       C
She said: "I have whiskeys and wines on the best!
       G            C             D7      G
And the words that I told you were only in jest!"




chorus


       G                                     C
I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done
   G           C            D7       G
And ask them to pardon their prodigal son
   G                                     C
And when they've caressed me as oftimes before
 G          C             D7       G
I never will play the wild rover no more.
