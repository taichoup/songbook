Traditional - Banks of the Ohio 

as sung by Doc Watson (Capo III)

Cette chanson est extrÃªmement glauque 


C                         G
I asked my love to take a walk

G7                      C
Just a little ways with me
          C7                  F
And as we walked and we would talk
      C       G        C
All about our wedding  day


(chorus, ideally with male/female harmony)

Darling say that you'll be mine
In our home we'll happy be
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

(break)

I took her by her pretty white hand
I led her down that bank of sand
I pushed her in where she would drown
Lord, I saw her as she floated down

(chorus)

Returning home about twelve or one
Thinking "Lord, what a deed I've done?"
I killed the girl I love, you see
Because she would not marry me

(chorus)

(break)

The very next day at half past four
The sheriff walked right to my door
And he says Young man, don't try to run
You'll pay for this awful crime you've done

(chorus)
