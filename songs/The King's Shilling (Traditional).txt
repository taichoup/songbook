These are the chords to James Taylor's version:

2/4. Capo II for Karan Casey's version

 G
(Oh my) love  has left me with bairnes twa
                 C                  G
^ And that's the last of him I ever saw
               C                   Em
He ^joined the army and marched to war
            Am7
He took the shilling,
             C                D      G
He took the shilling and he's off to war

Chorus:
G      C        G                     C
(Come) laddies, come, hear the cannon roar
                Em                  D      G
Take the king’s shilling and you’re off to war

G                         C       G
(Well, did) he look as he marched along
                    C                      Em
(With his) kilt and sporran and his musket gun
           C                        Em
The ladies tipped him as he marched along
          Am7               C          D      G
He sailed out by, he sailed out by the Broomielaw

           C         G          C       G
(Well the) pipes did play as he marched along
                 C                 Em
And the soldiers sang out a battle song
                  C                     Em
"March on, march on,” cried the captain gay
             Am7                   C               D     G
For king and country, for king and country we will fight today

(Chorus)

           C      G              C        G
(Well the) battle rattled to the sound of guns
                  C             G       Em
And the bayonets flashed in the morning sun
              C            G      Em
The drums did beat and the cannon roared
                 Am7                          C                  D         G
And the shilling little seemed, oh the shilling didn’t seem much worth the war


          C        G              C       G
Well, the men they fought and the men did fall
            C           G      Em
Cut down by bayonet and musket ball
        C     G           Em
Many of these brave young men
            Am7                    C             D    G
Would never fight for, would never fight for the King again

G      C        G                     C
(Come) laddies, come, hear the cannon roar
                Em                  D      G
Take the king’s shilling and you’re off to war
G      C        G                     C
(Come) laddies, come, hear the cannon roar
                Em                  D      G
Take the king’s shilling and you’re off to war
G      C        G                     C
(Come) laddies, come, hear the cannon roar
                Em                  D      G
Take the king’s shilling and you’re off to war
       C           G
Die in war, die in war
       C           G
Die in war, die in war
