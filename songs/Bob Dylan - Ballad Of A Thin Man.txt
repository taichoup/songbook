Bob Dylan - Ballad Of A Thin Man

Piano song, original key B minor. Here's a guitar version in Am, which is what he usually plays these days. The Dm can be played x-0-3-2-3-0, which makes the transition between Am and Dm quite smooth. I'm quite certain I've heard him play that himself, just can't remember where/when.
The chords of the initial descending bass line can be played with a sustained Am and a descending bass, or as in the more elaborate Budokan version (see below).
In the second verse (at least) there is a D sounding in the F of the last line, which would make it an F6 or a Dm/f.
The intro then goes like this:


       Am           Dm  Am
       :      .     .     .
----||---------0---0-0---0--------||---
----||*--------1---1-3---1-------*||---
----||---------2---2-2---2--------||---
----||---------2---2-3---2--------||--- etc
----||*-0------------------------*||-0-
--0-||-------------------------0--||---


Or in a rhythm from the Never-Ending Tour (1995; in 1998 he's back to the version above):
      Am           Dm  Am    Dm            Am
      :      .     .     .       :     .     .     .
---||---------0---0-0---0-----0-|-----------0-------------||
---||*--------1---1-3---1-----3-|-----------1------------*||
---||---------2---2-2---2-----2-|-----------2-------------||
---||---------2---2-3---2-----3-|-----------2-------------||
---||*-0------------------------|------------------------*||
-0-||---------------------------|-------------------------||

The A in red right above("ta-TA") should be a down-up stroke, it sounds better that way

Album Version


Capo 2nd fret

Am
You walk into the room
/g#
With your pencil in your hand
/g
You see somebody naked
      /f#
And you say, "Who is that man?"
F
You try so hard
       Dm
But you don't understand
C                  Em
Just what you will say
            Am
When you get home
 C                  Em
Because something is happening here
       Am
But you don't know what it is
F              Am
Do you, Mister Jones?



You raise up your head *)
And you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And somebody points to you and says
"It's his"
And you say, "What's mine?"
And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
And you say, "Oh my God
Am I here all alone?"
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says, "How does it feel
To be such a freak?"
And you say, "Impossible"
As he hands you a bone
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?


Am
You have many contacts
C
Among the lumberjacks
  F
To get you facts
                              Am
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
C
Anyway they already expect you
  F
To just give a check
  Dm                           G         (/g#)
To tax-deductible charity organizations


You've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers **) you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You're very well read
It's well known
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels ***)
And he says, "Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan"
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word "NOW"
And you say, "For what reason?"
And he says, "How?"
And you say, "What does this mean?"
And he screams back, "You're a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home"
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is ****)
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones *****)
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
