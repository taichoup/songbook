        Dm     A7    Dm       D2 Dm
Seen the arrow on the doorpost
               A7        Dm     D2 Dm
Saying, 'This land is condemned'
      A         C          G
All the way from New Orleans
Bb       C      Dm D2 Dm
  To Jerusalem


I traveled through east Texas
Where many martyrs fell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell


Well I heard that hoot owl singing
As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Were his only audience


Them charcoal gypsie maidens
Can strut their feathers well
But nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell


See them big plantations burning
Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
See the ghosts of slavery ships


I can hear them tribes a-moaning
Hear the undertaker's bell
Nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell


There's a woman by the river
With some fine young handsome man
He's dressed up like a squire
Bootlegged whisky in his hand


There's a chain gang on the highway
I can hear them rebels yell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
