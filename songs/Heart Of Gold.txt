Neil Young - Heart Of Gold

[Verse]

Em C D G
I want to live, I want to give
Em  C   D   G
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
Em   C D   G
It's these expressions I never give

[Chorus]

Em7 G
That keep me searching for a heart of gold
C  Am  G
And I'm getting old
Em7 G
That keep me searching for a heart of gold
C  Am  G
And I'm getting old

[Verse]

Em   C   D   G
I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
Em   C   D   G
I've crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
Em   C   D   G
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line

[Chorus]

Em7  G
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
C  Am  G
And I'm getting old
Em7  G
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
C  Am  G
And I'm getting old

[Chorus]

Em  D Em
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
Em D   Em
You keep me searching and I'm getting old
Em  D Em
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
Em  G
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
