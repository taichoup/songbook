           C                   G        
       Oh, Jesse   had a   wife    to  mourn   for his
               G           D   D7
       life.   Three   children,   they    were    br  ave.
               G       G7      C
       But that    dirty   little  coward  that    shot
           G       G       D7   
       Mister  Howard  Has laid    poor    Jesse   in
           G
       his grave.

       G                   C        
It  was on  a   Saturday    night,  the moon    was shining
G       G           D   D7   
bright, They    robbed  the Glendale    train.      With
               G                       C           G
the agent   on  his knees,  he  de  livered up  the keys
       G   D7          G
To  the outlaws Frank   and Jesse   James.

[chorus]

   G                       C    
The people  held    their   breath  when    they    heard   of
   G       G                    
Jesse's death,  They    wondered    how he  ever    came    to
D   D7      G                       C
fail.       Robert  Ford,   it  was a   fact,   shot    Jesse
       G       G           D7       
in  the back    While   Jesse   hung    a   picture on  the
G
wall.

[chorus]

   G                   C           G    
Oh, Jesse   was a   man,    a   friend  of  the poor,   He'd
G                       D   D7      G    
never   rob a   mother  or  a   child.      He  stole   from
               C           G           G
the rich    and he  gave    to  the poor,   So  they    shot
   D7          G
Jesse   James   on  the sly.
            
[chorus]

   G                   C       G    
Well,   this    song    was made    by  Billy   Ga  shade   As
G                       D   D7          G
soon    as  the news    did ar  rive.       He  said    there
                   C           G        
was no  man with    the law in  his hand    Who could
G       D7          G
take    Jesse   James   when    a   live.
