[Verse 1]
G               D        Em          Bm
Do you have the time to listen to me whine
 C                  G               D
About nothing and everything all at once
G             D
I am one of those
  Em          Bm
Melodramatic fools
  C             G
Neurotic to the bone
                 D
No doubt about it
[Chorus]
C         D                G
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
  C         D                    G
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
   C               D
It all keeps adding up
   G         F      E(m)
I think I'm cracking up
  C           D
Am I just paranoid? 
N.C.
I'm just stoned
[Instrumental]
G    D     C     D
G    D     C     D
[Verse 2]
G         D
I went to a shrink
    Em        Bm
To analyze my dreams
    C                 G                    D
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me__ down
  G         D
I went to a whore
   Em               Bm
He said my life's a bore
    C                G                    D 
And quit my whining cause it's bringing her__ down
[Chorus]
C         D                G
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
  C         D                    G
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
   C               D
It all keeps adding up
   G         F      Em
I think I'm cracking up
  C           D
Am I just paranoid? 
N.C.
Ee Ya ya ya.
[Instrumental]
G    D     C     D

G    D     C     D
G    D     C     D
[Bridge]
C             D
Grasping to control
                 G      D
So you better hold__ on__

Em   Bm   C   G   D
G   D   Em   Bm   C   G   D
[Chorus]
C         D                G
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
  C         D                    G
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
   C               D
It all keeps adding up
   G         F      Em
I think I'm cracking up
  C           D
Am I just paranoid? 
N.C.
Am I just stoned?
