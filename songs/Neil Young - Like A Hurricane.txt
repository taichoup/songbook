Neil Young - Like A Hurricane

[Verse 1]

Am                              G

Once I thought I saw you in a crowded, hazy bar,

F                                     Em  G

dancing on the light from star to star.

Am                            G

Far across the moon beams, I know that's who you are.

   F                                      Em  G

I saw your brown eyes turning once to fire.

C   G    F        G       C        G   F       G

You are like a hurricane: there's calm in your eye.

C    G   F            G

And I'm getting blown away. 

F

There's somewhere safer where the feelings stay.

                 Am   G   F   Em      G

I wanna love you but I'm getting blown away.



[Verse 2]

Am                              G

I am just a dreamer, but you are just a dream,

F                                     Em  G

and you could have been anyone to me.

Am                            G

Before that moment you touched my lips,

   F                                      Em  G

that perfect feeling when time just slips 

   F                                      Em  G

away between us and our foggy trips.

C   G    F        G       C        G   F       G

You are like a hurricane: there's calm in your eye.

C    G   F            G

And I'm getting blown away. 

F

There's somewhere safer where the feelings stay.

                 Am   G   F   Em      G

I wanna love you but I'm getting blown away.



[Verse 3]

Am                              G

You are just a dreamer, and I am just a dream,

F                                     Em  G

and you could have been anyone to me.

Am                            G

Before that moment you touched my lips,

   F                                Em  G

that perfect feeling when time just slips

   F                               Em  G

away between us and our foggy trips.

C   G    F        G       C        G   F       G

You are like a hurricane: there's calm in your eye.

C    G   F            G

And I'm getting blown away. 

F

There's somewhere safer where the feelings stay.

                 Am   G   F   Em      G

I wanna love you but I'm getting blown away.
