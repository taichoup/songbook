The Dubliners - Building Up And Tearing England Down

[Verse 1]
       C                        F             G
I have won a heroes name with McAlpine and Costain,
         C                F        G        C
With Fitzpatrick, Murphy, Ashe and Wimpey's gang.
          C                        F               G
I've been often on the road, on my way to draw the dole,
             C               F      G      C
When there's nothing left to do for Johnny Laing.
  Am                 F            Em             E7
I used to think that God made the mixer pick and hod,
        Am               G              F
So that Paddy might know hell above the ground.
         C                             F               G
I've had gangers big and tough tell me tear it all out rough,
            C               F       G       C
When you're building up and tearing England down.
 
[Verse 2]
    C                            F            G
I remember Carrier Jack with his hod upon his back,
       C                  F       G        C
How he swore one day he'd set the world on fire.
        C                                 F             G
But his face they've never seen since his shovel it cut clean,
            C           F        G       C
Through the middle of a big high tension wire.
  Am               F              Em          E7
I saw auld Balls Mccaul, from the big flyover fall,
  Am            G              F
Into a concrete mixer spinning round,
            C                            F              G
Although it was not his intent, he got a fine head of cement,
            C               F       G       C
When he was building up and tearing England down.
 
[Verse 3]
      C                    F              G
I was on the hydro dam the day that Pat Mccann
        C             F       G    C
Got the better of his stammer in a week.
        C                                F                    G
He fell from the shuttering jam and that poor auld stuttering man,
       C          F      G         C
He was never ever more inclined to speak.
   Am              F            Em                  E7
No more like Robin Hood will he roam through Cricklewood,
   Am               G              F
Or dance around the pubs of Camden Town.
    C                       F             G
But let no man complain, no Paddy dies in vain,
          C               F       G       C
When he's building up and tearing England down.

[Verse 4]
     C                          F                G
In a tunnel underground a young Limerick man was found,
       C              F      G     C
He was built into the new Victoria Line.
         C                               F                    G
When the pouring gang had past, sticking through the concrete cast,
        C              F       G     C
Was the face of little Charlie Joe Devine.
         Am          F             Em            E7
And the ganger man McGurk said big Paddy ate the work,
         Am                 G               F
When the gas main burst and he flew off the ground
        C                                       F              G
Oh they swear he said "Don't slack, it won't be long until I'm back"
        C               F       G       C
Keep on building up and tearing England down.
 
[Verse 5]
   C                              F                  G
So come all you navvies bold, who think that English gold,
        C             F     G         C
Is just waiting to be taken from each sod.
            C                              F        G
Or that the likes of you and me could ever get an OBE,
     C                   F       G      C
Or a knighthood for good service to the hod.
            Am              F        Em                E7
They've the concrete master race, to keep you in your place,
      Am            G               F
and a ganger man to kick you to the ground.
       C                        F               G
If you ever try to take part of what the bosses make,
             C               F       G       C
When they're building up and tearing England down.
       C                        F               G
If you ever try to take part of what the bosses make,
             C               F       G       C
When they're building up and tearing England down.
