Pete Seeger - The Water Is Wide (Traditional)

Capo III for James Taylor version

D G F#m  A7

             D    G
The water is wide
              D
I can't cross over
            Bm   G
And neither have
           A7sus4  A7
I wings to fly
           F#m   Am7
Build me a boat
               G   Em
That can carry two
               F#m  A7sus4
And both shall row
            D
My love and I

           D    G
There is a ship
                  D
And she sails the sea
             Bm   G
She's loaded deep
            A
As deep can be
           F#m   Am7
But not so deep
                G  Em
As the love I'm in
           F#m  A7sus4
I know not how
          D   D Dsus4 D(hammer)
I sink or swim

           D       G
Oh love is handsome
            D
And love is fine
             Bm     G
The sweetest flower
                A
When first it's new
               F#m
But love grows old
          D    G
And waxes cold
           F#m  A7
And fades away
     G      D
Like summer dew

D G D Bm G A
           
           F#m
Build me a boat
               D   G
That can carry two
               F#m  A7
And both shall row
   G        D
My love and I
               F#m  A7
And both shall row
   G        D
My love and I
