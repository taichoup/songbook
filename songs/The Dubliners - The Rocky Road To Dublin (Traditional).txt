 Am                         Am                
In the merry month of June,  When first from home I started
 Am                          G
Left the girls of Tuam,  So sad and broken hearted
  Am                    Am
Saluted Father dear,  Kissed me darlin' Mother
 Am                         G
And drank a pint of beer,  Me grief and tears to smother
 Am                     G   Am                G
Then off to reap the corn,  Leave where I was born
  Am              G             G                 G
Cut a stout blackthorn,  To banish ghosts and goblin
 Am                G        Am              G
Bought a pair of brogues,  Rattle over the bogs
 Am               G     G                      G
Frightened all the dogs,  On the rocky road to Dublin


 Am          G           Am
One, Two, Three, Four, Five
 Am                         Am
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
 G                       Am       G     Am
And all the ways to Dublin, Whack fol la de da


 Am                     Am
When in Mullingar that night,  I rested limbs so weary
 Am                       G
Started by daylight, Me spirits bright and early
 Am                   Am
Took a drop o' pure, Keep me heart from sinking
 Am                        G
That's a paddy's cure,  Whenever he's on drinking
 Am                 G        Am             G
To see the lassie's smile,  Laughing all the while
 Am              G             G                   G
At me curious style,   Would set your heart to bubbling
 Am              G     Am        G
Asked me I was hired, Wages I required
 Am              G    G                      G
I was almost tired, On the rocky road to Dublin


 Am          G           Am
One, Two, Three, Four, Five
 Am                         Am
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
 G                       Am       G     Am
And all the ways to Dublin, Whack fol la de da


 Am                       Am
Well in Dublin next arrived,  I thought it be a pity
 Am                      G
To be so soon deprived, A view of that fine city
 Am                    Am
Then I took a stroll,  All among the quality
 Am                   G
Me bundle it was stole,  In a neat locality
 Am                 G      Am             G
Something crossed me mind,  When I looked behind
 Am             G       G                G
No bundle could I find,  Upon me stick a wobbling
 Am                 G          Am                G
Enquiring after the rogue, They said me Connacht brouge
 Am              G    G                      G
Wasn't much in vogue, On the rocky road to Dublin


 Am          G           Am
One, Two, Three, Four, Five
 Am                         Am
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
 G                       Am       G     Am
And all the ways to Dublin, Whack fol la de da


 Am                     Am
Well, From  there I got away,  Me spirits never failing
 Am                      G
Landed on the quay,  Just as the ship was sailing
 Am                    Am
Captain at me roared,  Said that no room had he
 Am                        G
When I jumped aboard,  A cabin found for Paddy
 Am             G       Am                G
Down among the pigs,  Played some hearty rigs
 Am                 G           G               G
Danced some hearty jigs,  The water round me bubblin'
 Am         G           Am               G
When off Holyhead,  I wished meself was dead
 Am          G      G                      G
Or, Better far instead,  On the rocky road to Dublin

 Am                  Am
Well, The boys of Liverpool,  When we safely landed
 Am                       G
Called meself a fool,  I could no longer stand it
 Am                     Am
Blood began to boil,  Temper I was losing
 Am                     G
Poor ould Erins Isle,  They began abusing
 Am                 G        Am             G
Hurrah me soul says I,    Shillelagh I let fly
 Am             G     G            G
Some Galway boys were by,  Saw I was a-hollerin'
 Am                G            Am             G
Then with a loud horray,  They joined in the affray
 Am                 G     G                      G
We quickly cleared the way,  For the rocky road to Dublin
