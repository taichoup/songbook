Nirvana - All Apologies

Tuning: Eb – Drop D

[Intro]

[D] x4 

[Verse]

D
What else should I be all apologies
D
What else should I say; everyone is gay 
D
What else could I write; I don't have the right 
D
What else should I be; all apologies 


[Chorus]

G5
In the sun, in the sun I feel as one 
G5                         A   
In the sun, in the sun I'm married 
A
Burried (yah, yah, yah, yeah) 


[Verse]

D
I wish I was like you; easily amused 
D
Find my nest of salt; everything’s my fault 
D
I'll take all the blame; aqua seafoam shame 
D
Sunburn with freezer burn 
D
Choking on the ashes of her enemies 


[Chorus]

G5
In the sun, in the sun I feel as one 
G5                         A   
In the sun, in the sun I'm married 
A
Burried (yah, yah, yah, yeah) 


[Bridge]

A        A  
Married, Burried (yah, yah, yah, yeah) 


[Outro]

D
All in all is all we are 
D
All in all is all we are 
D
All in all is all we are 
D
All in all is all we are
