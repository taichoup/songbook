E             
I hear the train a-coming, it's rolling round the bend
                                               E7  
and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
   A                                              E    
I'm stuck at Folsom Prison, and time keeps draggin' on
        B7                                    E
But that train keeps a-rollin' on down to San Antone
E
When I was just a baby, my Mama told me 'Son,
                                          E7
always be a good boy; don't ever play with guns.'
     A                                       E
But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die
      B7                                           E
when I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and cry
[Guitar solo/interlude]
E
I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
                                          E7
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars
     A                                       E
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
      B7                                       E
But those people keep a moving, and that's what tortures me
[Guitar solo/interlude]
E
Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
                                          E7
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
     A                                       E
Far from Folsom Prison, that's where I want to stay
      B7                                           E
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away
