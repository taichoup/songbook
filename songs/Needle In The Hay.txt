Vs.1
       F5          A5   F5       C5     E5         A5
  Your hand on his arm, haystack charm around your neck
 F5              A5    F5           C5               E5        A5
  Strung out and thin, calling some friend trying to cash some check
       F5     A5    F5                 E5        A5      
  He's acting dumb, that's what you've come to expect

Vs.2
  He's wearing your clothes, head down to toes a reaction to you
  You say you know what he did, but you idiot kid you don't have a        
clue
  Sometimes you just get caught in the eye, you're pulling him        
through
                      

Chorus


Middle 8
     Fmaj7     Am      Fmaj7       C        E

     A5


Vs.3
   Now on the bus, nearly touching this dirty retreat
   Faling out, sixth and Powell, a dead sweat in my teeth
   Gonna walk walk walk, four more blocks plus the one in my brain

Vs.4
   Down downstairs, to the man he's gonna make it all OK
   I can't beat myself, I can't beat myself, and I don't wanna talk
   I'm taking the cure, so I can be quiet
              F
   Wherever I want
                G         E           Am              F 
   So leave me alone, you ought to be proud that I'm getting good
