Hank Williams - Cold Cold Heart

C                                                    G7
I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream
                                                   C
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
                                      C7        F
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
   G7                                                      C
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your Cold Cold Heart

                                                  G7
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
                                                 C
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
                                   C7                 F
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start 
  G7                                                      C
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your Cold Cold Heart

                                                     G7
You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
                                                       C
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
                                    C7                F
Why do you run and hide from life to try it just ain't smart
   G7                                                      C
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your Cold Cold Heart

                                                    G7
There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
                                            C
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
                                    C7             F
The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart
   G7                                                      C
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your Cold Cold Heart
