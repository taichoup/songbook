The Beatles - Help

[Intro]



Bm                Bm/A

Help! I need somebody 

G                 G/F#

Help! Not just anybody

E

Help! You know I need someone,

A

Help!





[Verse]



A                            C#m               F#m

When I was younger, so much younger than today,

                          D       G   A

I never needed anybody's help in any way.

                                C#m                 F#m

But now those days are gone I'm not so self-assured,

                                        D    G       A

Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the door.





[Chorus]



 Bm                                 Bm/A    G                            G/F#  

Help me if you can I'm feeling down, and I do appreciate you being 'round.

 E                                                  A

Help me get my feet back on the ground, won't you please please help me.





[Verse]



                              C#m                   F#m

And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,

                           D     G       A

My independence seemed to vanish in the haze.

                         C#m                 F#m

But every now and then I feel so insecure,  

                                        D    G     A

I know that I just need you like I've never done before.





[Chorus]



 Bm                                 Bm/A    G                            G/F#

Help me if you can I'm feeling down, and I do appreciate you being 'round.

 E                                                 A

Help me get my feet back on the ground, won't you please please help me.





[Verse]
