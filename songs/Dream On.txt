         Ev'ry     time that I  look in the  mirror
         Fm            Fm7          Fm6            Bbm6       
         All these lines on my  face gettin' clearer
         Fm            Fm7          Fm6            Bbm6     
                   The past is  gone
         Fm            Fm7          Fm6            Bbm6

[Bridge]  Dm7b5              C    Dm7b5               Bbm6

         Fm          Eb               Db                 Eb

         Half my       life's in    books' written pages  
         Fm            Fm7          Fm6            Bbm6
         Lived and     learned from fools and from sages
         Fm            Fm7          Fm6            Bbm6
         You know it's true
         Fm            Fm7          Fm6            Bbm6

[Chorus]  Fm                    Eb                  
         Sing with me,             sing for the years. 
         Db                        Eb
         Sing for the laughter and sing for the tears.
         Fm                        Eb
         Sing with me if it's      just for today,
         Dm7b5                     Dbmaj7
         Maybe tomorrow the        good Lord will take you away
