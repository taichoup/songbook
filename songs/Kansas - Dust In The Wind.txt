[Verse]

  C     G/B  Am

I close my   eyes

G          Dm7

only for a moment

        Am           G/B

and the moment's gone

C   G/B  Am

all my   dreams

G              Dm7        Am

pass before my eyes a curiosity

D/F# G           Am  Am/G

     dust in the wind

D/F#          G           Am   G/B

all we are is dust in the wind



C    G/B   Am

Same old   song

G              Dm7

just a drop of water

       Am          G/B

in the endless sea

C   G/B  Am

all we   do

G               Dm7

crumbles to the ground

            Am         

though we refuse to see

D/F# G           Am    Am/G

     dust in the wind

D/F#          G           Am   G  Dm7

all we are is dust in the wind

[Verse]

G/B   C     G/B  Am

Now,  don't hang on

G               Dm7

nothing last forever

        Am            G/B

but the earth and sky

   C     G/B Am

it slips a   way

    G    

And all your money

Dm7           Am

won't another minute buy

D/F# G           Am    Am/G

     dust in the wind

D/F#          G           Am   Am/G  

all we are is dust in the wind

D/F# G           Am    Am/G

     dust in the wind

D/F#          G           Am

everything is dust in the wind
