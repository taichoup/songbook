The Highwaymen - The Road Goes On Forever

[Verse 1]
          D
Sherry was a waitress
 
At the only joint in town
             G
She had a reputation
 
As a girl who'd been around
          D
Down main street after midnight
 
Brand new pack of cigs
            G
A fresh one hanging from her lips
 
A beer between her legs
            A
She'd ride down to the river
 
And meet with all her friends
 
[Chorus]
             G
The road goes on forever
                             D
And the party never ends
 
 
Verse 2:(Willie Nelson)
          D
Sonny was a loner
 
Bolder than the rest
            G
He was goin' in the Navy
 
But he couldn't pass the test
            D
So he hung around town
 
He sold a little pot
             G
The law caught wind of Sonny
 
One day he got caught
            A
But he was back in business
 
When they set him free again
 
[Chorus]
             G
The road goes on forever
                             D
And the party never ends
 
[Verse 3]
          D
Sonny's playin' eight ball
 
At the joint where Sherry works
          G
When some drunken out of towner
 
Put his hand up Sherry's skirt
          D
Sonny took his pool cue
 
Laid the drunk out on the floor
          G
Stuffed a dollar in her tip jar
 
Walked on out the door
           A
She's runnin' right behind him
 
Reachin' for his hand
 
[Chorus]
             G
The road goes on forever
                             D
And the party never ends
 
[Verse]
          D
They jumped into his pick-up
 
Sonny jammed her down in gear
          G
Sonny looked at Sherry
 
Said,"Let's get out of here"
              D
The stars were high above them
 
The moon was in the east
             G
The sun was setting on them
 
When they reached Miami Beach
              A
They got a motel by the water
 
And a quart of Bombay Gin
 
[Chorus]
             G
The road goes on forever
                             D
And the party never ends
 
[Verse]
          D
They soon ran out of money
 
But Sonny knew a man
             G
Who knew some Cuban refugees
 
Who dealt in contreband
          D
Sonny met the Cuban
 
In a house just off the route
          G
With a briefcase full of money
 
And a pistol in his boot
              A
The cards were on the table
 
When the law came bustin' in
 
[Chorus]
             G
The road goes on forever
                             D
And the party never ends
 
[Verse]
             D
The Cubans grabbed the goodies
 
And Sonny grabbed the jack
            G
He broke the bathroom window
 
And climbed on out the back
           D
Sherry drove the pick-up
 
Through the alley on the side
          G
Where the lawman tackled Sonny
 
And was reading him his rights
            A
She stepped out in the alley
 
With a single shot four-ten
 
[Chorus]
             G
The road goes on forever
                             D
And the party never ends
 
[Verse]
          D
They left the lawman dyin'
 
They made their get away
          G
Got back to the motel
 
Just before the break of day
           D
Sonny gave her all the money
 
And he blew a little kiss
             G
If they ask you how this happened
 
Say i forced you into this
              A
She watched him as his tail lights
 
Disappeared around the bend
 
[Chorus]
             G
The road goes on forever
                             D
And the party never ends
 
[Verse]
          D
There's main street after midnight
 
Just like it was before
           G
Twenty-one months later
 
At the local grocery store
           D
Sherry buys a paper
 
And a cold six pack of beer
              G
The headlines read that Sonny
 
Is going to the chair
              A
She pulls back onto main street
 
In her new Mercedes-Benz
 
[Chorus]
             G
The road goes on forever
                             D
And the party never ends
