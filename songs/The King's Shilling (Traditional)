The King's Shilling (Traditional)

These are the chords to James Taylor's version:

G6no3: xx5030

G6no3
Oh my love has left me with bairnes twa

And that's the last of him I ever saw
                                  Em
He joined the army and marched to war
            Am7
He took the shilling,
             C                D      G
He took the shilling and he's off to war

Chorus:
G     C        G                     Am
Come, laddies, come, hear the cannon roar
         G                   C      D      G
Take the king’s shilling and you’re off to war

G     C      G          C       G
Well, did he look as he marched along
                  C       G
With his kilt and sporran and his musket gun
           C      G                 Em
The ladies tipped him as he marched along
          Am7               C          D      G
He sailed out by, he sailed out by the Broomielaw

G        C         G          C       G
Well the pipes did play as he marched along
                 C    G
And the soldiers sang out a battle song
                  C   G                 Em
"March on, march on,” cried the captain gay
             Am7                   C               D     G
For king and country, for king and country we will fight today

(Chorus)

G         C      G              C        G
Well, the battle rattled to the sound of guns
                 C       G
And the bayonets flashed in the morning sun
              C    G              Em
The drums did beat and the cannon roared
                 Am7                          C                D         G
And the shilling little seemed, oh the shilling didn’t seem much worth the war


G         C        G              C       G
Well, the men they fought and the men did fall
            C   G
Cut down by bayonet and musket ball
     C  G                 Em
Many of these brave young men
            Am7                    C             D    G
Would never fight for, would never fight for the King again

G     C        G                     Am
Come, laddies, come, hear the cannon roar
         G               C          D       G
Take the king’s shilling and you'll die in  war…
G     C        G                     Am
Come, laddies, come, hear the cannon oar
         G               C          D      G
Take the king’s shilling and you'll die in war…
G     C        G                     Am
Come, laddies, come, hear the cannon roar
         G               C          D      G
Take the king’s shilling and you'll die in war…
       C           G
Die in war, die in war
       C           G
Die in war, die in war
