The Witcher - Toss A Coin To Your Witcher

[Verse 1]

 Am              D
 _ When a humble bard
               Dm
 Graced a ride along
                G
 With Geralt of Rivia
                  D    G E
 Along came this  song__
 

[Verse 2]
Am                          D
 _ From when the White Wolf fought
                  Dm
 A silver-tongued devil
             G
 His army of elves
                         D    G E
 At his hooves did they revel__


[Verse 3]
Am                 D
 _ They came after me
                  F
 With masterful deceit
               G
 Broke down my lute
          E            Am
 And they kicked in my teeth
 

[Verse 4]
Am                   D
 _ While the devil’s horns
                   F
 Minced our tender meat
                  G
 And so cried the Witcher
                   E
 He can’t be bleat
 
[Chorus]

Am        E            C
_ Toss a coin to your Witcher
    Dm            Am
 O’ Valley of Plenty
    Dm            Am
 O’ Valley of Plenty
 
Am        E            C
 _ Toss a coin to Your Witcher
    Dm        E      E7
 O’ Valley of Plenty
 
[Verse 5]
Am                    D
 _ At the edge of the world
                  Dm
 Fight the mighty horde
                 G
 That bashes and breaks you
                   D    G E
 And brings you to mourn__
 
[Verse 6]
Am                 D
 _ He thrust every elf
                 Dm
 Far back on the shelf
                G
 High up on the mountain
                D   G E
 From whence it came__
 
[Verse 7]
Am                   D
 _ He wiped out your pest
                   F
 Got kicked in his chest
                      G
 He’s a friend of humanity
    E            Am
 So give him the rest
 
[Verse 8]
Am                D
 _ That’s my epic tale
                 F
 Our champion prevailed
              G
 Defeated the villain
                       E
 Now pour him some ale
 
[Chorus 2]
Am        E            C
 _ Toss a coin to your Witcher
    Dm            Am
 O’ Valley of Plenty
    Dm            Am
 O’ Valley of Plenty
 
Am        E            C
 _ Toss a coin to your Witcher
   Dm        E       E7
 A friend of humanity
 
[Chorus 3]
Am        E            C
 _ Toss a coin to your Witcher
    Dm            Am
 O’ Valley of Plenty
    Dm            Am
 O’ Valley of Plenty
 
Am        E            C
 _ Toss a coin to your Witcher
   Dm        E       E7
 A friend of humanity
 
[Chorus 4]
Am        E            C
 _ Toss a coin to your Witcher
    Dm            Am
 O’ Valley of Plenty
    Dm            Am
 O’ Valley of Plenty
 
Am        E            C
 _ Toss a coin to your Witcher
   Dm        E       E7
 A friend of humanity
 
[Outro]
