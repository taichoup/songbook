[Verse]

Am        C
Your beauty is beyond compare
      G                Am
With flaming locks of auburn hair
      G             Em              Am
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
      Am             C 
Your smile is like a breath of spring
      G                  Am
Your voice is soft like summer rain
      G         Em             Am
And i cannot compete with you, Jolene

[Verse]

Am             C
He talks about you in his sleep
    G                Am
There`s nothing i can do to keep
    G               Em               Am
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
   Am            C
And i can easily understand 
   G                 Am
How you could easily take my man
   G               Em                   Am
But you don`t know what he means to me, Jolene

[Chorus]

Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
     G                                Am
I`m begging of you please don`t take my man
 Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
 G                    Em             Am
Please don`t take him just because you can

[Verse]

Am              C
you could have your choice of men
   G              Am
But i could never love again
   G           Em          Am
He`s the only one for me, Jolene
  Am               C
I had to have this talk with you 
  G            Am
My happines depends on you
  G            Em           Am
Whatever you decide to do, Jolene

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
     G                                Am
I`m begging of you please don`t take my man
 Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
 G                    Em             Am
Please don`t take him even though you can
