Paul Simon - Fifty Ways To Leave Your Lover

NB: The Cmaj7 is just a C without the index finger, and the Ebdim can be replaced with a B7


[Verse]
 
Em                 D              Cmaj7               B7
   "The problem is all inside your head", she said to me,
Em7                D         Cmaj7        Ebdim
   The answer is easy if you take it logically.
Em7             D                Cmaj7          B7
   I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free.
                 Em       Am7                Em       Em
   There must be - fifty ways to leave your lover."
 
Em                  D            Cmaj7        B7
   She said: "It's really not my habit to intrude,
            Em            D              Cmaj7            Ebdim
   Furthermore I hope my meaning won't be lost or miss-construed,
             Em           D        Cmaj7          B7
   But I'll repeat myself, at the risk of being crude.
                 Em       Am7                Em        Em
   There must be - fifty ways to leave your lover, 
Em        Am7                Em
   Fifty ways to leave your lover."
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                   G                     Bb
Just slip out the back Jack, make a new plan Stan,
              C7                          G
No need to be coy Roy, just get yourself free
            G                             Bb
Hop on the bus Gus, you don't need to discuss much,
                  C7                         G
Just drop off the key Lee, and get yourself free.
 
               G                    Bb
Slip out the back Jack, make a new plan Stan,
                     C7                          G
You don't need to be coy Roy, you just listen to me.
            G                            Bb
Hop on the bus Gus, you don't need to discuss much,
                  C7                          G
Just drop off the key Lee, and get yourself free.
 
 
[Verse]
 
Em                 D             Cmaj7             B7
   She said: "It grieves me so to see you in such pain.
                  Em                  D           Cmaj7    Ebdim
   I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again."
                 Em          D               Cmaj7      B7
   I said: "I appreciate that and would you please explain
             Em      Am7     Em
   About the - fifty ways."
 
Em                 D                  Cmaj7          B7
   She said: "Why don't we both just sleep on it tonight,
            Em                D             Cmaj7            Ebdim
   And I believe that in the morning you'll begin to see the light."
             Em              D             Cmaj7        B7
   Then she kissed me and I realised, she probably was right,
                Em      Am7                Em
   There must be fifty ways to leave your lover,
Em        Am7                Em
   Fifty ways to leave your lover.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                   G                     Bb
Just slip out the back Jack, make a new plan Stan,
                     C7                          G
You don't need to be coy Roy, and get yourself free.
            G                             Bb
Hop on the bus Gus, you don't need to discuss much.
                  C7                          G
Just drop off the key Lee, and set yourself free.
 
                   G                     Bb
Just slip out the back Jack, make a new plan Stan,
              C7                      G
No need to be coy Roy, just listen to me.
            G                         Bb
Hop on the bus Gus, don't need to discuss much,
                  C7                          G
Just drop off the key Lee, and set yourself free.
