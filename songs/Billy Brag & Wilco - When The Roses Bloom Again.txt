Billy Brag & Wilco - When The Roses Bloom Again

Capo 5th.
 
[Verse 1]
          Em
They were strolling in the gloaming
          Am
Where the roses were in bloom
  C/G                                  G
A soldier and his sweetheart brave and true
          Em
And their hearts were filled with sorrow
          Am
For their thoughts were of tomorrow
       C/G                            G
As she pinned a rose upon his coat of blue
 
[Chorus]
       C/G
Do not ask me love to linger
         Am
When you know not what to say
    G                                 Em
For duty calls your sweetheart's name again
         C/G
And your heart need not be sighing
   Am
If I be among the dying
        G                  C            G
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again
 
[Verse 2]
         Em
When the roses bloom again
   Am
Beside the river
        C/G                              G
And the mockingbird has sung his sweet refrain
       Em
In the days of Old Lang Syne
        Am
I'll be with you sweetheart mine
        C/G                           G
I'll be with you when the roses bloom again
 
[Verse 3]
        Em
Mid the rattle of the battle
           Am
Came a whisper soft and low
  C/G                           G
A soldier who had fallen in the fray
     Em
I am dying, I am dying
      Am
And I know I'll have to go
              C/G                     G
But I want to tell you before I pass away
 
[Chorus]
          C/G
There's a far and distant river
          Am
Where the roses are in bloom
  G                                   Em
A sweetheart who is waiting there for me
         C/G
And it's there I pray you take me
          Am
I've been faithful, don't forsake me
        G                  C            G
I'll be with her when the roses bloom again
