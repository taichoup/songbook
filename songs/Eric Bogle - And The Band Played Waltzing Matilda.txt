Eric Bogle - And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda


(I prefer to play with the capo on the 2nd fret)


[Verse]

    G       C           G          Em   
When I was a young man I carried me pack
     G              D         G
And I lived the free life of a rover
                       C            G        Em  
From the Murray's green basin to the dusty Outback
 G             D        G
I waltzed my Matilda all over

       D       C             G
Then in 1915 me country said, Son
    D                                 C          G
It's time you stopped rambling there's work to be done
                 C                 G         Em
So they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun
        G            D         G
And they marched me away to the war

[Chorus]

    G                   C           G
    And the band played Waltzing Matilda
                           C           D   Dsus4  D
    When the ship pulled away from the quay
          C            Am          G          Em
    And amidst all the tears, flag-waving and cheers
       G              D      G  Gsus4  G
    We sailed off for Gallipoli

[Verse]

       G        C           G        Em
And how well I remember that terrible day
        G                 D            G
When our blood stained the sand and the water
               C              G          Em
And how in that hell that they call Suvla Bay
       G              D            G
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter

      D                       C              G
Johnny Turk he was ready, he'd primed himself well
  D                              C                G
He rained us with bullets, and he showered us with shells
                   C         G               Em
And in five minutes flat he'd blown us all to hell
      G            D            G
Nearly blew us back home to Australia

[Chorus]

    G                   C           G
    And the band played Waltzing Matilda
                       C        D   Dsus4  D
    When we stopped to bury our slain
    C         Am            G            Em
    We buried ours, and the Turks buried theirs
            G           D      G  Gsus4  G
    Then we started all over again

[Verse]

    G              C              G           Em   
And those that were left, well, we tried to survive
       G            D                G
In that mad world of blood, death and fire
                 C            G        Em  
And for ten weary weeks I kept myself alive
       G           D             G
While around me the corpses piled higher

      D                            C         G
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over head
   D                  C        G
And when I awoke in me hospital bed
                   C             G            Em
And saw what it had done, well, I wished I was dead
     G              D                 G
Never knew there was worse things than dying

[Chorus]

    G                  C           G
    So no more I'll go Waltzing Matilda
                         C            D   Dsus4  D
    All around the green bush far and near
       C             Am     G              Em
    To hump tent and pegs a man needs both legs
            G           D        G  Gsus4  G
    No more Waltzing Matilda for me

[Verse]

       G            C            G             Em   
So they gathered the wounded, the crippled, the maimed
        G               D            G
And they shipped us back home to Australia
                C            G            Em  
The armless, the legless, the blind, the insane
     G             D         G
Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla

   D                         C        G
And when the ship pulled into Circular Quay
 D                            C            G
I looked at the place where me legs used to be
                            C            G           Em
And thanked Christ there was no one there waiting for me
  G             D            G
To grieve and to mourn and to pity

[Chorus]

    G                   C           G
    And the band played Waltzing Matilda
                         C            D   Dsus4  D
    When they carried us down the gangway
        C      Am                 G               Em
    But nobody cheered, they just stood there and stared
              G                D      G  Gsus4  G
    Then they turned all their faces away

[Verse]

  G         C       G         Em   
So now every April I sit on my porch
     G            D          G
And I watch the parade pass before me
            C            G            Em  
I see my old comrades how proudly they march
 G          D              G
Renewing old dreams of past glory

       D                         C               G
And the old men march slowly, all bones stiff and sore
       D                       C         G
They're tired old heroes from a forgotten war
                    C               G             Em
And the young people ask, "What are they marching for?"
   G       D             G
And I ask myself the same question

[Chorus]

    G                  C           G
    And the band plays Waltzing Matilda
                          C          D   Dsus4  D
    And the old men still answer the call
        C          Am         G           Em
    But year after year their numbers are fewer
            G           D              G  Gsus4  G
    Someday no one will march there at all

[Verse]

G                 C
Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda
G                                   D
Who'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me?
         G             D        Em                C
And their ghosts may be heard as they march by the Billabong
C             G          D7         G
Who'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me?
