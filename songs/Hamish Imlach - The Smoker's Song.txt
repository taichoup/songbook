Hamish Imlach - The Smoker's Song

3/4, in C


C         G      C        F                 C
Now I'm a social outcast, A modern-day refugee.
F            G            F           G
Joy turns to gloom when I walk into a room.
D                             G
They all turn their back upon me.
C         G         C       F                        E
I'm not a thug or a mugger. I've not murdered anyone yet.
F                         G              Am
But you would think I was Charles bloody Manson
D               G          C-B-bB-Am     D  G  C
when I light up a cigarette.

Some folk get their kicks from alcohol.
Some stuff their nose with cocaine.
Some folk like knocking old women about.
Some like tae batter their weans.
There's masochists, sadists, and rapists,
folk that like dressing in drag.
I'm no' like them. That's no' my game.
Gimme peace just to light one more fag.

You can snuff it doing too much exercise.
You can snuff it not doing enough.
You can snuff it by eating too little.
You know, you can snuff it eating too much. (pause)
You can snuff it staying out late at night.
You can snuff it lying in your bed.
So my way of snuffing is to keep right on puffing.
It's on my own bloody head.

Spare a thought for all the smokers
Doing their bit for the Crown.
Remember when a smoker lights up,
he's keeping your income tax down.
Yes, he is. He's keeping your income tax down.
