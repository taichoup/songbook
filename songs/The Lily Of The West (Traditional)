The Lily Of The West (Traditional)

As sung by Mark Knopfler and The Chieftains

     C               G  C         Am       F/G    C        F
When first I came to Ireland some pleasure for to find
     C       G/B     Am     Em         C              F
It's there I spied a damsel fair, most pleasing to my mind
    C    G/B        Am        Em        C                 F        
Her rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes like arrows pierced my breast
    C                 G     C       Am   F/G    Csus     C
And I call her lovely Molly O', the lily of the west


    C            G    C       Am   F/G   C       F
One day as I was walking down by a shady grove
  C         G/B   Am        Em   C               F
I spied a lord of high degree conversing with my love
       C          G/B   Am     Em       C          F           
As she sang her song delightfully while I was sore oppressed
       C              G     C       Am   F/G    Csus     C
Saying I bid adieu to Molly O', the lily of the west



Well, I stepped up with my rapier and my dagger in my hand

And I dragged him from my false love and boldly I bid him stand

But being mad with desperation I swore I'd pierce his breast

I was then deceived by Molly O', the lily of the west



I then did stand stand my trial, and boldly I did plead

A flaw was in my indictment found and that soon had me freed

That beauty bright I did adore, the judge did her address

Now go, you faithless Molly O', the lily of the west



Now that I've gained my liberty a-rovin' I will go

I ramble through old Ireland and travel Scotland o'er

Though she thought to swear my life away she still disturbs my rest,

I still must style her, Molly O', the lily of the west.
