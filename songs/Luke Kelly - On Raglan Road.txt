  D                        G
On Raglan Road on an autumn day,
 D       G         D
I saw her first and knew
    G                   D
That her dark hair would weave a snare,
            Bm      A
that I might one day rue
 G              D
I saw the danger and I passed,
           Bm      A
along the enchanted way,
     D                             G
and I said: 'Let grief, be a fallen leaf
      D       G      D
at the dawning of the day'

  D                      G
On Grafton Street in November,
          D        G        D
we tripped lightly along the ledge
    G                  D
Of a deep ravine, where can be seen,
            Bm        A
the worth of passion's pledge
   G                      D
The Queen of Hearts, still making tarts,
         Bm     A
and I not making hay
     D                     
Oh, I loved too much and by such,
  G        D         G       D
by such, is happiness thrown away

 D                     G
I gave her gifts of the mind,
 D            G      D
I gave her the secret signs
      G                    D
That's known to the artists who have known,
                Bm        A
the true gods of sound and stone
   G                  D
And word and tint, without stint,
          Bm       A
I gave her poems to say
        D                                G
With her own name there, and her own dark hair,
    D           G         D
like clouds over fields of May

    D                              G
On a quiet street, where old ghosts meet,
 D       G       D
I see her walking now
G              D
Away from me so hurriedly,
         Bm     A
my reason must allow
    G                D
That I had loved, not as I should,
          Bm      A
a creature made of clay
        D                
When the angel woos the clay,
    G         D            G       D
he'd lose, his wings at the dawn of day
