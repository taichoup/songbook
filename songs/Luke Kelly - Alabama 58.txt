Luke Kelly - Alabama 58

Dm

Dm         C  Dm
In Alabama 1958
                  G            Dm
The cost of human life is very low
                       G       Dm
A man that's black is trampled down
     G         Dm              A     Dm
Just like they were a thousand years ago

CHORUS:
Dm                   C         Dm
But these are more enlightened days
   F                  C      F
No room for all these savage ways
G     A             Dm
Leave and let them go
          (G)     (Dm)     (G)     (Dm)   
Now every man may walk his road in peace
    A       Dm
For all are free!

Two thousand years ago a million men
Were gathered into royal Egypt's land
Were bound together, forced to build
Pyramids of stone in desert sand

CHORUS

Mary's son walked through a land of woe
Dreaming of the world as it could be
But the good and lawful men of Rome
Bound him like a robber to a tree

CHORUS

In Britain just a hundred years ago
The jails were full of good and hungry men
Diggers, fenians, many more
Fought and died but rose to fight again

CHORUS

Last year a negro stole a dollar bill
The judge he said "We mustn't be severe
Instead of death we'll give him life imprisonment
To show there's justice here"

CHORUS

And so throughout the ages you have seen
How progress marches ever on its way
No rack, no wheel, no Spanish boot
For Alabama's prisoners today

CHORUS 

In these more enlightened days
No room for all these savage ways
Leave and let them go
Now every man should walk his road in peace
Let man be free!
