Jesse Winchester - Sham-A-Ling-Dong-Ding

Capo: 2 fret

[Verse 1]
D-Bm7-Em7-A7-D-Em7,A7   (Em to A change walks up F#,G,A)
The boys were singing shing-a-ling 
The summer night we met 
You were tan and seventeen 
O how could I forget 
When every star from near and far 
Was watching from above 
Watching two teenagers fall in love 

[Verse 2]
D-Bm7-Em7-A7-D-Em7,A7(Gm add9/D)
The way we danced was not a dance 
But more a long embrace 
We held on to each other and 
We floated there in space 
And I was shy to kiss you while 
The whole wide world could see 
So shing-a-ling said everything for me 

[Chorus]
Em7,A7,D,Bm7,F#m7,Em7,A7sus4,sus9
And O the poor old old folks 
They thought we'd lost our minds 
They could not make heads or tails
Of the young folks' funny rhymes 

D-Bm7-Em7-A7
But you and I knew all the words 
And we always sang along to 
O sham-a-ling-dong-ding 
Sham-a-ling-dang-dong 

[Verse 3]
D-Bm7-Em7-A7-D-Em7,A7
So after years and after tears 
And after summers past 
The old folks tried to warn us 
How our love would never last 
And all we'd get was soaking wet 
From walking in the rain 
And singing sham-a-shing-a-ling again 

[Chorus 2]
Em7,A7,D,Bm7,F#m7,Em7,A7sus4,sus9
And O the poor old old folks 
They smile and walk away 
But I bet they did some 
Sham-a-lama-ding-dong in their day 

D-Bm7-Em7-A7

I bet that they still close their eyes 
And I bet they sing along to 
O sham-a-ling-dong-ding 
Sham-a-ling-dang-dong

[Bridge]
Bm7-D-Bm7-Em7-A7
O those sweet old love songs 
Every word rings true 
Sham-a-ling-dong-ding means sweetheart 
Sham-a-ling-dang-dong does too 

[Verse]
D-Bm7-Em7-A7
And it means that right here in my arms 
That's where you belong 
And it means sham-a-ling-dong-ding 
Sham-a-ling-dang-dong
