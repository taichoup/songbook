[Verse 1]

D               G

I don't care if Monday's blue

D                  A 

Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too

Bm             G

Thursday I don't care about you

     D             A 

It's Friday I'm in love



[Verse 2]

D              G 

Monday you can fall apart

D                 A

Tuesday Wednesday break my heart

Bm             G

Thursday doesn't even start

     D             A 

It's Friday I'm in love



[Chorus]

G        A

Saturday wait

Bm              G 

And Sunday always comes too late

    D            A 

But Friday never hesitate...



[Verse 3]

D               G

I don't care if Mondays black

D                 A 

Tuesday Wednesday heart attack

Bm           G 

Thursday never looking back

     D             A 

It's Friday I'm in love



[Interlude]

D G D A Bm G D A



[Verse 4]

D              G 

Monday you can hold your head

D                 A

Tuesday Wednesday stay in bed

   Bm               G 

Or Thursday watch the walls instead

D                  A 

It's Friday I'm in love



[Chorus]

G        A

Saturday wait

Bm              G 

And Sunday always comes too late

    D            A 

But Friday never hesitate...



[Bridge]

Bm                C                         D

Dressed up to the eyes, it's a wonderful surprise

            A                       Bm

To see your shoes and your spirits rise

                   C                             D

Throwing out your frown and just smiling at the sound

                   A 

And as sleek as a shriek spinning round and round

Bm                C                           D

Always take a big bite, it's such a gorgeous sight

         A                          Bm 

To see you eat in the middle of the night

                    C                    D

You can never get enough, enough of this stuff

           A

It's Friday I'm in love



[Repeat Verse 1]

D               G

I don't care if Monday's blue

D                  A 

Tuesday's grey and Wednesday too

Bm             G

Thursday I don't care about you

     D             A 

It's Friday I'm in love



[Repeat Verse 2]

D              G 

Monday you can fall apart

D                 A

Tuesday Wednesday break my heart

Bm             G

Thursday doesn't even start

     D             A 

It's Friday I'm in love
