Capo III


Am
Was you ever in Quebec ?
Dm             Em
Bonnie Laddie, Hieland Laddie
Am
Stowing timber on the deck,
Dm        Em      Am
My Bonnie Hieland Laddie.

Chorus:
F   C          G7    C
Hey ho, and  away we go.
Dm             Em
Bonnie Laddie, Hieland Laddie.
F   C     G7    C 
Hey ho, away we go,
   Dm     Em      Am
My Bonnie Hieland Laddie.

Was you ever in Callao,
Bonnie Laddie, Hieland Laddie,
Where the girls are never slow,
My Bonnie Hieland Laddie.
Was you ever in Baltimore, etc.
Dancing on that sanded floor, etc.

Was you ever in Mobile Bay,
Loading cotton by the day,

Was you on the Brummallow,
Where Yankee boys are all the go,

Was you ever in Dundee,
There some pretty ships you'll see,

Was you ever in Merrimashee,
Where you make fast to a tree,

Was you ever in Aberdeen,
Prettiest girls you've ever seen,
