[Intro]
Em
 
[Verse]
Em
It will make a weak man mighty
C                         Dsus2
It will make a mighty man fall
Em
It will fill your heart and hands
C                         Dsus2
Or leave you with nothing at all
Em
It's the eyes for the blind
C                Dsus2
The legs for the lame
Em
It is love for hate
C           Dsus2
And cry for shame
 
[Chorus]
    Em
    That's the power of the gospel
                             Bm
    That's the power of the gospel
    Em                       C
    That's the power of the mighty power
    Bm                   Em
    That's the power of the gospel
 
Gospel on the water
Gospel on the land
The gospel in every woman
And the gospel in every man
Gospel in the garden
Gospel in the trees
The gospel that's inside of you
The gospel inside of me
 
    That's the power of the gospel
    That's the power of the gospel
    That's the power of the mighty power
    That's the power of the gospel
 
In the hour of richness
In the hour of need
For all creation
Comes from the gospel seed
Now you may leave tomorrow
And you may leave today
But you've got to have the gospel ready
When you start out on your way
 
    That's the power of the gospel
    That's the power of the gospel
    That's the power of the mighty power
    That's the power of the gospel
