Auld Triangle (Traditional)

[Verse 1]

G
A hungry feeling
G
Came o'er me stealing
       C         Em
And the mice were squeeling
     Am     C
In my prison cell
                G
And that auld triangle went jingle-jangle
     C       Em           D     G
All along the banks of the Royal Canal

[Verse 2]

Oh! To start the morning
The warden bawling
"Get up out of bed, you! And Clean out your cell!"
And that auld triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal

[Verse 3]

Oh! the screw was peeping
And the loike was sleeping
As he lay weeping
For his girl Sal
And that auld triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal

[Verse 4]

On a fine Spring evening
The loike lay dreaming
And the sea-gulls were wheeling
High above the wall
And that auld triangle went jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal

[Verse 5]

Oh! the wind was sighing
And the day was dying
As the loike lay crying
In his prison cell
And that auld triangle went jingle-bloody-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal

[Verse 6]

In the women's prison
There are seventy women
And I wish it was with them
That I did dwell
Then that auld triangle could go jingle-jangle
All along the banks of the Royal Canal
