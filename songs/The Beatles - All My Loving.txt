The Beatles - All My Loving

[Verse 1]



           Em            A7          D           Bm

Close your eyes and I´ll kiss you, tomorrow i´ll miss you,

  G           Em        C     A7

remember I´ll always be true.

         Em         A7             D         Bm

And then while I´m away I´ll write home everyday

         G           A         D

and I´ll send all my loving to you.





[Verse 2]



        Em            A7           D         Bm

I´ll pretend that I´m kissing, the lips I am missing

    G            Em               C     A7

and hope that my dreams will come true.

         Em         A7             D         Bm

And then while I´m away I´ll write home everyday

         G           A         D

and I´ll send all my loving to you.





[Chorus]



       Bm     Bbaug          D

All my loving I will send to you.

       Bm      Bbaug           D

All my loving, darling I´ll be true.
