Neil Young - Don't Let It Bring You Down


[Verse 1]

 A                                    
 Old man lying by the side of the road
          Am7               
 With the lorries rolling by
 D                                            
 Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load
         F                    Em7 
 And the buildings scrape the sky       



 Cold wind rippling down the alley at dawn
 And the morning paper fly
 Dead man lying at the side of the road
 And the daylight in his eyes

[Chorus]:

 Em7            D7            
   Don't let it bring you down
                   C      
 It's only castles burning
                    Bm7    
 Find someone who's turning
                    A    
 And you will come around

 G A C  A G A C

[Verse 2]

Blind man running through the light of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down to the river of sight and
You can really understand

Red light flashin' through the window in the rain
Can you hear the sirens moan?
White cane lying in the gutter in the lane 
And you're walking home alone

[Chorus] x 2, then 

G A C  A D A D instead.
