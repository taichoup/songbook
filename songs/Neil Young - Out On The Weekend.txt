A                         Bm
Think I'll pack it in and buy a pick-up
E                 A
Take it down to L.A.
                        Bm
Find a place to call my own and try to fix up.
E                 A
Start a brand new day.

    A                          Bm
The woman I'm thinking of, she loved me all up
E                 A
But I'm so down today
            
She's so fine, she's in my mind.
Bm               E Esus4
I hear her calling.

A                   Bm
See the lonely boy, out on the weekend
E                 A
Trying to make it pay.
                        Bm
Can't relate to joy, he tries to speak and
E              A
Can't begin to say.

A                             Bm
She got pictures on the wall, they make me look up
E                  A
From her big brass bed.
                              Bm
Now I'm running down the road trying to stay up
E                A
Somewhere in her head.

A                              Bm
The woman I'm thinking of, she loved me all up
E                  A
But I'm so down today
            
She's so fine, she s in my mind.
Bm               E Esus4
I hear her calling.

See the lonely boy, out on the weekend
