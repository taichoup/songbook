Open or Capo I*

      G          C            G
It's a lesson too late for the learnin',
C       G   D         G
made of sand, made of sand
                 C              G
In the wink of an eye my soul is turnin',
C       G   D         G
in your hand, in your hand.

       D                  C           G 
Are you going away with no word of farewell,
          C        G            D    D7
will there be not a trace left behind?
       G                    C    
Well, I could have loved you better,
      G                 
didn't mean to be unkind;
   D                 D7               G
you know that was the last thing on my mind.

          G         C          G
You've got reasons a-plenty for goin',
C      G   D        G
this I know, this I know.
                       C        G
For the weeds have been steadily growin',
C            G  D             G
please don't go, please don't go.

you know that was the last thing on my mind.

                 C             G
As we walk on, my thoughts keep tumblin',
C         G    D           G
round and round, round and round
                       C       G
Underneath our feet the subways rumblin',
C    G     D      G
underground, underground

       D                  C           G 
Are you going away with no word of farewell,
          C        G            D    D7
will there be not a trace left behind?
       G                    C    
Well, I could have loved you better,

didn't mean to be unkind;
   D                 D7               G
you know that was the last thing on my mind.

              C          G
As I lie in my bed in the mornin',
C       G  D         G
without you, without you.
                C             G
Every song in my breast lies a bornin',
C       G  D         G
without you, without you.

       D                  C           G 
Are you going away with no word of farewell,
          C        G            D    D7
will there be not a trace left behind?
       G                    C    
Well, I could have loved you better,
      G                 
didn't mean to be unkind;
   D                 D7               G
you know that was the last thing on my mind.
