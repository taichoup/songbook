[Verse 1]



 G       D                            G

 Well, I dreamed I saw the knights in armour coming,

        D                 G

 Sayin' something about a queen.

             D                    A

 There where peasants singin' and drummers drummin'

         G                A

 And the archer split the tree.

             Bm              C

 There was a fanfare blowin' to the sun

          G               C

 that was floating on the breeze.

 D                     A

 Look at Mother Nature on the run

        C             G

 In the nineteen seventies.

 D                     A

 Look at Mother Nature on the run

        C             G

 In the nineteen seventies.





[Verse 2]

      D                     G

I was lying in a burned out basement

       D               G

With a full moon in my eye

      D          A

I was hoping for replacement

         G                     A

When the sun burst through the sky

            Bm           C

There was a band playing in my head

      G                 C

And I felt like getting high

      D                       A

I was thinking about what a friend had said

      C                G

I was hoping it was a lie

D                       A

Thinking about what a friend had said

      C                G

I was hoping it was a lie





[Horn solo] (lasts one verse)





[Verse 3]

G      D                        G

Well I dreamed I saw the silver spaceship flying

       D                  G

In the yellow haze of the sun

           D                   A

There were children crying and colors flying

    G                 A

All around the chosen one

         Bm              C

All in a dream, all in a dream

    G           C

The loading had begun

D                      A

Flying mother nature's silver seed

     C               G

To a new home in the sun

D                      A

Flying mother nature's silver seed

     C               G

To a new home...
