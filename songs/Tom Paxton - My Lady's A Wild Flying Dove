Tom Paxton - My Lady's A Wild Flying Dove

Capo on 2

(Verse 1)
C               F   C
Some ladies are foolish
                G7
Some ladies are gay
C               F   C
Some ladies are comely
     G               C
Some live while they may

(Chorus)
                        Am
My lady's a wild flying dove
Dm         G7
My lady is wine
C                 F   C
She whispers each evening
            G7
She's mine, mine, mine

(Verse 2)
C                F   C
She likes pretty pictures
                  G7
She loves singing birds
C                 F   C
She'll watch them for hours
     G         C
But I see only her

(Chorus)
                        Am
My lady's a wild flying dove
Dm         G7
My lady is wine
C                 F   C
She whispers each evening
            G7
She's mine, mine, mine

(Verse 3)
C               F   C
She tells me she's learning
                G7
Just how full her cup can be
C               F   C
She asks me to help her
            G              C
But I know, she's teaching me

(Chorus)
