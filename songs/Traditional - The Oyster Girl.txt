A
As I was a-walking down a London street
         D                     B              E
A pretty little oyster girl I chanced for to meet
  A                        D            A  
I lifted up her basket and boldly I did seek
                           E  A
Just to see if she had any oysters

Oysters, oh oysters, oysters, said she
These are the finest oysters ever you will see
I sell them three a penny but I'd give them to you free
For I see you are a lover of oysters

Oh Landlord, oh landlord, landlord, I cried
Have you got a little room that's empty and nearby
Where me and my pretty little oyster girl may lie
While we bargain for her basket of oysters

We hadn't been upstairs for a quarter hour or more
When that pretty little oyster girl started for the door
She'd gone picked my pocket, down the stairs she tore
But she left me with a basket of oysters

Oh landlord, oh landlord, landlord, I cried
Did you see that little oyster girl drinking by my side
She's gone picked my pocket, but the landlord just replied
Son, you shouldn't be so fond of your oysters
