Tom Paxton - My Ramblin' Boy

G        D          D7        G
He was a man and a friend always
             D                       G
He stuck with me through the hard old days
                   C
He never cared if I had no dough
           D           D7       G
We rambled round in the rain and snow.


CHORUS:
D             G       C       G
And here's to you, my ramblin' boy
             D         D7      G
May all your ramblin' bring you joy.
D             G        C        G
And here's to you, my ramblin' boy
            D     D7           G
May all your ramblin bring you joy.


In Tulsa town, we chanced to stray

we thought we'd try to work one day

The boss says had room for one

says my old pal, we'd rather bum.


REPEAT CHORUS:


Late one night in a hobo camp

the weather it was cold and damp

He got the chills and he got 'em bad.

They took the only freind I had


REPEAT CHORUS:


He left me here, to ramble on

My old pal is dead and gone

If when we die, we go somewhere

I bet you a dollar, he's ramblin there. 


REPEAT CHORUS:
