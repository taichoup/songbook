[Verse 1]

Em7        D/F#      G

   Tell me something girl...

C                        G      D

   Are you happy in this modern world?

Em7      D/F#     G

   Or do you need more?

C                                 G         D

   Is there something else you’re searching for?



[Verse 2]

   Em7 D/F# G

   I’m fall-in'

C                          G      D           Em7 D/F# G

   In all the good times I find myself longin'    for  change

C                         G      D     Em7  D/F# G

   And in the bad times I fear myself



Em7 D/F#  G



[Verse 3]

Em7        D/F#      G

   Tell me something boy...

C                             G         D

   Aren’t you tired tryin' to fill that void

Em7      D/F#     G

   Or do you need more?

C                           G      D

   Ain’t it hard keeping it so hardcore



[Verse 4]

   Em7 D/F# G

   I’m fall-ing

C                          G      D           Em7 D/F# G

   In all the good times I find myself longin'    for  change

C                         G      D

   And in the bad times I fear myself



[Chorus]

Am                    D/F#

I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in

G           D        Em

I’ll never meet the ground

Am                         D/F#

Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us

      G            D       Em

We’re far from the shallow now



[Post–Chorus]

Am               D/F#

   In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low

G         D             Em

   In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low

Am               D/F#

   In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low

         G            D       Em

   We’re far from the shallow now



[Bridge]

Bm   D

Wooaaaah

A     Em    Bm    D    A

Woaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh



[Chorus]

Am                    D/F#

I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in

G           D        Em

I’ll never meet the ground

Am                         D/F#

Crash through the surface, where they can’t hurt us

      G            D       Em

We’re far from the shallow now



[Post-Chorus]

Am               D/F#

   In the sha-ha-sha-ha-low

G         D             Em

   In the sha-ha-sha-la-la-la-low

Am               D/F#

   In the sha-ha-sha-ha-ha-low

         G            D       Em

   We’re far from the shallow now
