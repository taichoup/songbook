The Rolling Stones - Wild Horses

On a 12-string

[Verse 1]
Bm     G      Bm         G
Childhood living is easy to do
Am                     C  D  G                    D     C
The things that you wanted     I bought them for you
Bm        G          Bm       G
Graceless lady you know who I am
Am                C      D G                D
You know I can't let you   slide through my hands
[Chorus]
Am   C     D G        F        C   D
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
Am   C     D G        F        C
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away
[Verse 2]
Bm            G       Bm            G 
I watched you suffer a dull aching pain
Am           C    D G              D    C
Now you've decided, to show me the same
Bm             G      Bm             G
No sweeping exit or offstage lines
Am              C      D G               D
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind
[Chorus]
Am   C     D G        F        C   D
Wild Horses, couldn't drag me away
Am          C     D G        F        C
Wild, wild horses couldn't drag me away
[Verse 3]
Bm       G           Bm          G
I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie
Am       C       D G                    D     C
I have my freedom but I don't have much time
Bm            G        Bm           G
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried
Am           C      D G          D 
Let's do some living, after we die
[Chorus]
Am   C     D G        F        C   D
Wild Horses, couldn't drag me away
Am   C     D G        F        C
Wild wild Horses, we'll ride them some day
Am   C     D G        F        C   D
Wild Horses, couldn't drag me away
Am   C     D G        F        C
Wild wild Horses, we'll ride them some day
Either fade it out or end with a: D(transitional) G
