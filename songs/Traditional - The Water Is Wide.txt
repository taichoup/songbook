Traditional - The Water Is Wide

(As sung by Pete Seeger)

Capo III for James Taylor version

D G F#m  A7

             D    G
The water is wide
              D
I can't cross over
            Bm-a-G
And neither have
           A  A7 A
I wings to fly
           F#m   G
Build me a boat
               Bm-a-G
That can carry two
               F#m  A7sus4
And both shall row
            D
My love and I

           D    G
There is a ship
                  D
And she sails the sea
             Bm-a-G
She's loaded deep
            A  A7 A
As deep can be
           F#m   G
But not so deep
                Bm-a-G
As the love I'm in
           F#m  A7sus4
I know not how
          D   D Dsus4 D(hammer)
I sink or swim

           D       G
Oh love is handsome
            D
And love is fine
             Bm-a-G
The sweetest flower
                A  A7 A
When first it's new
               F#m  G
But love grows old
          Bm-a-G
And waxes cold
           F#m  A7
And fades away
     G      D
Like summer dew

D G D Bm G A
           
           F#m
Build me a boat
               D   G
That can carry two
               F#m  A7
And both shall row
   G        D
My love and I
               F#m  A7
And both shall row
   G        D
My love and I
