[Verse 1]

A                     G6 

Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',

A               G6 

I was layin' in bed

A                  G6 

Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all

       D               

If her hair was still red.

A                       G6 

Her folks they said our lives together

A                 G6 

Sure was gonna be rough

A                          G6 

They never did like Mama's homemade dress

       D 

Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.

E                         F#m 

And I was standin' on the side of the road

A                  D 

Rain fallin' on my shoes

E                   F#m 

Heading out for the East Coast

     A                    D            E 

Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through,

G       D     A    Asus  A  Asus

Tangled up in blue.



[Verse 2]

A                     G6 

She was married when we first met

A                     G6 

Soon to be divorced

A                     G6 

I helped her out of a jam, I guess,

      D

But I used a little too much force.

A                     G6 

We drove that car as far as we could

A                     G6 

Abandoned it out West

A                     G6 

Split up on a dark sad night

        D

Both agreeing it was best.

E                    F#m 

She turned around to look at me

A                  D 

As I was walkin' away

E               F#m 

I heard her say over my shoulder,

     A                    D            E 

"We'll meet again someday on the avenue,"

G       D     A    Asus  A  Asus

Tangled up in blue.



[Verse 3]

A                     G6 

I had a job in the great north woods

A                     G6 

Working as a cook for a spell

A                     G6 

But I never did like it all that much

      D

And one day the ax just fell.

A                     G6 

So I drifted down to New Orleans

A                     G6 

Where I happened to be employed

A                     G6 

Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat

      D

Right outside of Delacroix.

E                              F#m 

But all the while I was alone

A                  D 

The past was close behind,

E                              F#m 

I seen a lot of women

     A                    D            E 

But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew

G       D     A    Asus  A  Asus

Tangled up in blue.



[Verse 4]

A                     G6 

She was workin' in a topless place

A                     G6 

And I stopped in for a beer,

A                     G6 

I just kept lookin' at the side of her face

      D

In the spotlight so clear.

A                     G6 

And later on as the crowd thinned out

A                     G6 

I's just about to do the same,

A                     G6 

She was standing there in back of my chair

      D

Said to me, "Don't I know your name?"

E                    F#m 

I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,

A                  D 

She studied the lines on my face.

E                              F#m 

I must admit I felt a little uneasy

     A                    D            E 

When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,

G       D     A    Asus  A  Asus

Tangled up in blue.



[Verse 5]

A                G6               A            G

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe

A                      G6                        

"I thought you'd never say hello," she said

     D

"You look like the silent type."

 A                       G6 

Then she opened up a book of poems

A                     G6 

And handed it to me

A                     G6 

Written by an Italian poet

     D 

From the thirteenth century.       

E                     F#m 

And every one of them words rang true

A                  D 

And glowed like burnin' coal

E                              F#m 

Pourin' off of every page

     A                    D            E 

Like it was written in my soul from me to you,

G       D     A    Asus  A  Asus

Tangled up in blue.



[Verse 6]

A                     G6 

I lived with them on Montague Street

A                     G6 

In a basement down the stairs,

A                     G6 

There was music in the cafes at night

      D

And revolution in the air.

A                     G6 

Then he started into dealing with slaves

A                     G6 

And something inside of him died.

A                     G6 

She had to sell everything she owned

      D

And froze up inside.

E                    F#m 

And when finally the bottom fell out

A                  D 

I became withdrawn,

E                              F#m 

The only thing I knew how to do

     A                    D            E 

Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,

G       D     A    Asus  A  Asus

Tangled up in blue.



[Verse 7]

A                     G6 

So now I'm goin' back again,

A                     G6 

I got to get to her somehow.

A                     G6 

All the people we used to know

      D

They're an illusion to me now.

A                     G6 

Some are mathematicians

A                     G6 

Some are carpenter's wives.

A                     G6 

Don't know how it all got started,

      D

I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.

E                 F#m 

But me, I'm still on the road

A                  D 

Headin' for another joint

E             F#m 

We always did feel the same,

     A                    D            E 

We just saw it from a different point of view,

G       D     A    Asus  A  Asus

Tangled up in blue.
