D G A 2x
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       D                G     Em        A
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
      D             G       Em        A         D
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.


G            A              D              G
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship,
D                   G            D                   G
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,
  D                G          D           G
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
Em    A
To be wanderin'.
   G           A             D            G
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
 D         G                 D                G
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
 Em            A
I promise to go under it.


G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       D                G     Em        A
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
      D             G       Em        A         D
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.


G                  A          D             G
Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand,
D                G
Vanished from my hand,
       D               G         Em        A
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
  G          A             D             G
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
 D              G
I have no one to meet
       D             G            Em       A
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.


G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       D                G     Em        A
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
      D             G       Em        A         D
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.


G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
       D                G     Em        A
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
G        A               D               G
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
      D             G       Em        A         D
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.
