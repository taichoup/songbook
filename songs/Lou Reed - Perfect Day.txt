Lou Reed - Perfect Day

(Capo I)

[Intro]

E  Am  E  Am

[Verse]

Am     D

Just a perfect day,

G            C

Drink Sangria in the park,

F               Dm

And then later, when it gets dark,

      E

We go home.

Am     D

Just a perfect day,

G           C

Feed animals in the zoo

F          Dm

Then later, a movie, too,

         E

And then home.


[Chorus]


   A           D

Oh it's such a perfect day,

    C#m                  D    D/C#  D/B

I'm glad I spent it with you.

A         E

Oh such a perfect day,

         F#m     E       D

You just keep me hanging on,

         F#m     E       D

You just keep me hanging on.


[Verse]


Am     D

Just a perfect day,

G            C

Problems all left alone,

F         Dm

Weekenders on our own.

          E

It's such fun.

Am     D

Just a perfect day,

G              C

You made me forget myself.

F               Dm

I thought I was someone else,

        E

Someone good.





[Chorus]



   A           D

Oh it's such a perfect day,

    C#m                  D    D/C#  D/B

I'm glad I spent it with you.

A         E

Oh such a perfect day,

         F#m     E       D

You just keep me hanging on,

         F#m     E       D

You just keep me hanging on.
