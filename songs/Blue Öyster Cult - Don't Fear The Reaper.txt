[Verse]

Am G    F   G  Am   G F G
Love of two is one
Am G     F   G       Am   G F G
Here but now they're gone
F             G        Am
Came the last night of sadness
          F         G           Am
And it was clear she couldn't go on
        F                     G      Am
Then the door was open and the wind appeared
   F       G         Am
The candles blew then disappeared
   F        G         Am                   G         Am
The curtains flew then he appeared...saying don't be afraid

[Chorus]

G       Am             G      Am
Come on baby...and she had no fear
       G      Am              G          Am
And she ran to him...then they started to fly
           G            Am                    G           Am
They looked backward and said goodby...she had become like they are
       G         Am             G           Am
She had taken his hand...she had become like they are
G       Am           G        Am
Come on baby...don't fear the reaper . . .
