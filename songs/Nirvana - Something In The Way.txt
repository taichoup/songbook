Nirvana - Something In The Way

TUNING: Eb



[Intro]

F#5-D5---; (2x)

 
[Verse]

F#5             D5
Underneath the bridge

F#5                    D5
The tarp has sprung a leak

F#5           D5
And the animals i´ve trapped

F#5                 D5
Have All become my pets

F#5         D5
And Im living off grass

F#5                 D5
And the drippings from the ceiling

F#5           D5
its O.K. eat fish

F#5               D5
Cause they don't have any feelings

 
[Chorus]

F#5               D5
Something in the way

F#5     D5
Mmmm......

F#5               D5
Something in the way

F#5     D5
Mmmm......

 
[Verse]

F#5             D5
