Traditional - Wayfaring Stranger

(As sung by Johnny Cash)

[Intro]  
Am  Dm  E  Am

[Verse]

Am
I'm just a poor
Wayfaring stranger
            Dm
Travelling through
            Am
This world below
There is no sickness
No toil, nor danger
               Dm
In that bright land
E           Am
To which i go

[Chorus]

F
I'm going there
          C
To see my father
           F
And all my loved ones
           E  E7 E
Who've gone on
         Am
I'm just going over jordan
        Dm  E       Am
I'm just going over home
[Instrumental]
Am  Dm  E  Am      Am  Dm  E  Am

[Verse]

Am
I know dark clouds
Will gather round me
         Dm 
I know my way
            Am
Is hard and steep
But beautious fields
Arise before me
           Dm 
Where god redeems
Em            Am
There vigils keep

[Chorus]

F
I'm going there
          C
To see my mother
               F
She said she'd meet me
       E  E7 E
When I come
         Am
I'm just going over jordan
        Dm  E       Am  (end dead on this chord)
I'm just going over home
