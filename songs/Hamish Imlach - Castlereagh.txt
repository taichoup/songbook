The songs works well played fast, but it's also fine at a moderate pace.

Written by Banjo Patterson, an Australian man who also wrote "Waltzing Mathilda"
It's a shearer's union song (syndicat de tondeurs de moutons)

    Dm     F        A     G      Dm    (C   G) Dm
I'm riding down the Castlereagh, I'm a station hand
                                    (or G)  
	Dm           F              Dm    F      A
I'm handy with a rope and whip, handy with a brand
Dm    F      A     G       Dm       C       Dm 
I can ride a rowdy colt or swing an axe all day
Dm                      F            Dm        C     Dm
There's no demand for a station hand along the Castlereagh


F      A     Dm           F         A         Dm
Shift, boys, shift, there isn't the slightest doubt
F                                                A
It's time to make a move to the stations further out
     Dm      F     Dm   C     Dm       C     Dm
So I saddled up my pony and I whistled on my dog
Dm              F              A      C   Dm
Made for up the country at the old... jig jog

I went to Illawarra where - my brother has a farm
He has to ask his landlord's leave before he'd raise an arm
The landlord owns the countryside - man, woman, dog and cat
They haven't the cheek to dare to speak without they touch their hat

Shift, boys, shift, there isn't the slightest doubt
The little landlord god and I - would soon have fallen out
Was I to tip my hat to him? Was I his bloody dog?
So I made for up the country at the old... jig jog

I answered a call for shearing once - along the Marthaga
We shear non-union here, says he, I'd call that scab, says I
I looked along the shearing-shed - before I turned to go
There were four-and-twenty scabbies there shearing in a row

Shift, boys, shift, there isn't the slightest doubt
It's time to make a move - when the leprosy's about
So I saddled up my pony and I whistled on my dog
Made for up the country at the old... jig jog

<Harmonica interlude>

It's time that I was travelling, it's a mighty way to go
Till I drink Artesian water from a thousand feet below
Till I see the overlander - with his cattle coming down
I'll work a while, make a pile, have a spree in town

Shift, boys, shift, there isn't the slightest doubt
It's time that I was moving to the stations further out
So I saddled up my pony and I whistled on my dog
Made for up the country at the old... jig jog
