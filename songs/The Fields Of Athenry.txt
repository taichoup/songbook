Verse 1
 
D                            G                  D   A   
By the lonely prison wall, i heard a young girl cal-ling
D                 G           A
Micheal they have taken you a-way
        D               G           D                   A
For you stole trevelins corn so the young might see the morn
A                                 D 
A prison ship lies waiting in the bay

Chorus 
D   G       D             Bm         
Low Lie The fields of athenry 
      D                   Bm               A 
where once we watched the small free birds fly
    D            G 
our love was the wing 
       D                   A
We had dreams and songs to sing
A                                      D
and so lonely round the fields of athenry

Verse 2

D                            G                 D   A 
By the lonely prison wall, i heard a young man cal-ling
D               G              A
Nothing matters mary when your free
            D              G          D                  A               
against the famine and the crown, i rebelled they cut me down
A                                  D
now you must raise our child with dignity

Chorus

D   G       D              Bm         
Low Lie The fields of athenry 
      D                   Bm               A 
where once we watched the small free birds fly
    D            G 
our love was the wing 
       D                   A
We had dreams and songs to sing
A                                   D
and so lonely round the fields of athenry

Verse
D                              G                     D  A
By the lonely harbor wall, she watched the last star fa-ll
       D                  G               A
as the prison ship sailed out against the sky
        D                 G            D               A 
for she lived to hope and pray for her love in botany bay
A                                           D
and it's so lonely round the fields of athenry
