Stan Rogers - Barrett's Privateers


[Verse]

      C                  G       C
Oh the year was seventeen-seventy-eight
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now.
 C         G           C        C
A letter of marque came from the king
      C                    G    F
To the scummiest vessel I'd ever seen

[Chorus]

  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold
    G       C
We'd fire no guns
G       F
Shed no tears
     C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateers

[Verse]

  C              G         C
Oh Euclid Barrett cried the town
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
   C            G        C          C
For twenty brave men, all fishermen, who
     C                G          F
Would make for him the Antelope's crew

[Chorus]

  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold
    G       C
We'd fire no guns
G       F
Shed no tears
     C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateers

[Verse]

   C                    G         C
The Antelope sloop was a sickening sight
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
       C                        G        C
She'd a-list to the port and her sails in rags
       C           C                 G            F
And the cook in the scuppers with the staggers and jags

[Chorus]

  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold
    G       C
We'd fire no guns
G       F
Shed no tears
     C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateers

[Verse]

      C                  G      C
On the king's birthday we put to sea
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
       C                G       C
We were ninty-one days to Montego Bay
C            C      G       F        
Pumping like madmen all the way

[Chorus]

  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold
    G       C
We'd fire no guns
G       F
Shed no tears
     C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateers

[Verse]

      C                    G       C
On the ninethy-sixth day we sailed again
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
      C                   G       C
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
        C            C            G       F
With our cracked four-pounders, we made to fight

[Chorus]

  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold
    G       C
We'd fire no guns
G       F
Shed no tears
     C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateers

[Verse]

   C              G         C
The Yankee lay low down with gold
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
       C                 G          C
She was broad and fat and loose with stays
      C                  C        G         F
But to catch her took the Antelope two whole days

[Chorus]

  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold
    G       C
We'd fire no guns
G       F
Shed no tears
     C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateers

[Verse]

       C                   G       C
Then at length we stood two cables away
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
   C                             G      C
Our cracked four-pounders made an aweful din
        C       C             G        F
But with one fat ball the Yank stove us in

[Chorus]

  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold
    G       C
We'd fire no guns
G       F
Shed no tears
     C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateers

[Verse]

   C                  G              C
The Antelope shook and pitched on her side
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
C           C              G       C
Barrett was smashed like a bowl of eggs
       C          C           G       F
And the main truck carried off both me legs

[Chorus]

  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold
    G       C
We'd fire no guns
G       F
Shed no tears
     C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateers

[Verse]

  C                 G            C
So here I lay in the twenty-third year
     C      F      C          G
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now
    C        C              G      C
It's been six years since we sailed away
     C         C       G     F
And I just made Halifax yesterday

[Chorus]

  G         C
Goddamn them all
C     F
I was told
    C         F          C      F
We'd cruse the seas for American gold
    G       C
We'd fire no guns
G       F
Shed no tears
     C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateers

[Outro]

(Slowly)
C      F        C       F
I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier (hold it)
   F       F         G    C
The last of Barrett's privateeeeeerrrrssss (go wild on the C)
