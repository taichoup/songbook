[Verse]
 
Dsus2        Dsus2/F         G
My friends are so depressed
C(add9)     Dsus2
I feel the question
      Dsus/F        G
Of your loneliness
  Gsus  F6/9       Dsus2           Dsus2/F     G
Confide..., 'cause I'll be on your side
C(add9)       Dsus2     Dsus2/F    G C(add9)
You know I will, you know I will
 
D         Dsus2/F         G
X Girlfriend called me up
C(add9)     D
Alone and desperate
       Dsus/F        G
On the prison phone
C(add9)         D         Dsus2/F     G
They want... to give her 7 years
Csus2
For being sad
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C        Asus2
  I love all of you
C     D      A(add2)
Hurt by the cold
C        Asus2
So hard and lonely too
C     D      A(add2)
When you don't know yourself
 
 
[Verse]
 
D         Dsus2/F         G
My friends are so distressed
C(add9)     D
And standing on
         Dsus2/F         G
The brink of emptiness
C(add9)     D            Dsus2/F     G
No words... I know of to express
Csus2
This emptiness
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C        Asus2
  I love all of you
C     D      A(add2)
Hurt by the cold
C        Asus2
So hard and lonely too
C     D      A(add2)
When you don't know yourself
 
 
[Bridge]
 
G  F6   E       G6  F#7(add4)      F
        Imagine me taught by tragedy
C          Bsus      F5   F7
Release is peace
D         Dsus2/F         G
I heard a little girl
C(add9)     D
And what she said
           Dsus2/F         G
Was something beautiful
C(add9)     D            Dsus2/F     G
To give... your love
Csus2
No matter what
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C        Asus2
  I love all of you
C     D      A(add2)
Hurt by the cold
C        Asus2
So hard and lonely too
C     D      A(add2)
When you don't know yourself
