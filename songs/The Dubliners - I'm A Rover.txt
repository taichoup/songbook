[CHORUS]
G               C        G
I'm a rover and seldom sober
                       D
I'm a rover, o' high degree
              G                    C   G

Though the night be dark as dungeon
                       D
No' a star can be seen above,
          G                C   G
I will be guided without a stumble
G                   D        G
Into the arms o' my own true love

G                    C          G
He stepped up to her bedroom window,
                       D
Kneelin' gently upon a stone
             G                   C  G
He whispered through her bedroom-window
G                        D     G
"My Darlin' dear, do you lie alone?"

G                            C             G
She raised her head from her down-white pillow
                           D
Through her arms about her breast,
            G                  C  G
"say who is that at my bedroom window
G                   D            G
Disturbin' me at my long night's rest?"

Open the door and let me in.
           G                     C  G
For I have come on a long nights journey,
G                     D      G
And I'm near drenched to the skin."

She opened the door and she let him in,
                 G                       C  G

[VERSE 6]
G                           C               G
The cocks were crowin', the birds were whistlin'
                                  D
The burns they ran free abune the brae
           G           C            G

And the farmer I must obey."
