Tom T Hall - I Flew Over Our House Last Night
 
C                                  F
That old Kentucky moon was shining bright as day
    G7                          F     C
The stars were twinkling in the milky way
                                 F
The pilot said if you look close there's Frankfort on the right
G7                         C
I flew over our house last night
 
F                             C
Thirty thousand feet below me you were fast asleep
F                              C                   G7
And thirty thousand feet above I almost stopped to weep
C                            F
So close and yet so far away so wrong and yet so right
G7                         C
I flew over our house last night
 
                                F
For just one second I thought I was back in town
    G7                           F                C
The man your friends all say has only brought you down
                                 F
The airline hostess asked me sir are you sure that you're alright
G7                         C
I flew over our house last night
