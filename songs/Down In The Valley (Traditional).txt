Down In The Valley
                   G                           D7
Down in the valley, the valley so low, 
                                                        G
Hang your head over, hear the winds blow. 
                                                                D7
Hear the winds blow, dear, hear the winds blow. 
                                                        G
Hang your head over, hear the winds blow.


Down in the valley, walking between, 
Telling our story, here’s what it means. 
Here’s what it means, dear, here’s what it means, 
Telling our story, here’s what it means.
Roses love sunshine, violets love dew, 

Angels in heaven know I love you; 
Know I love you, dear, know I love you, 
Angels in heaven know I love you.
Build me a castle forty feet high, 
So I can see him as he rides by; 

As he rides by, dear, as he rides by, 
So I can see him as he rides by.
Writing this letter, containing three lines, 
Answer my question, "Will you be mine?" 
"Will you be mine, dear, will you be mine," 

Answer my question, "Will you be mine?"
If you don’t love me, love whom you please, 
Throw your arms round me, give my heart ease. 
Give my heart ease, dear, give my heart ease, 
Throw your arms round me, give my heart ease.

Throw your arms round me, before it’s too late; 
Throw your arms round me, feel my heart break. 
Feel my heart break, dear, feel my heart break. 
Throw your arms round me, feel my heart break.
