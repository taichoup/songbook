CAPO III

Verse 1a:

     Am                         C                 G
Three years ago this very day we went to Governors Isle
      Am                  F         G
For to stand against the cannon / in true military style
  Am                            C                 G
Seventeen American dollars each month we'd surely get
    Am                               F           Am
For to carry a gun and a bayonet with regimental step


Verse 1b:

  C
We had a choice of going to the army or to jail
       Am                         G
Oh it's up the Hudson River with a copper take a sail
     F                                C            G
Oh we puckered up our courage and with bravery we did go
     Am                G                  D            Am        
Oh we cursed the day we went away with the Regular Army O


Chorus:

There was Sergeant John McCaffery and Captain Donahue
Oh they made us march and toe the mark in gallant company Q
Well the drums would roll upon me soul this is the style we go
Forty miles a day on beans and hay in the Regular Army O




We be dry as army herrings and as hungry as a Turk
The boys along the street cry out "soldier will you work"
We'd ship into the Navy for to plow the raging seas
But cold water, sure, we couldn't endure. Twould never agree with me

We'd join the politicians and we know we'd be well fed
Oh we sleep no more upon the ground but in a feather bed
And if a war it should break out, they call on us to go
We'll get Italian substitutes in the Regular Army O




Chorus


With cords upon our heels me boys and bunions on our toes
From lugging the gun in the red hot sun with freckles on our nose
England tells us grenediers, France wears its zu zus
The USA never changes they say but always wears the blues

When we are out to pomperade our muskets must be bright
Or they'll slap us in the guardhouse to pass away the night
And when we want a furlough to the colonel we do go
Go to bed and wait till you're dead in the Regular Army O



Chorus x 2
