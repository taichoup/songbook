RICH KID BLUES
                      TERRY REID
NOTE: VERSES are based on the chords D, Dsus4, and Dsus2.
INTRO:  Dm  C  G   *Dsus2-h-D (Means to make a Dsus2 
                              chord and immediately
                              hammer on the high E string
                              to form a D chord.)
VERSE:
D      Dsus4        D       Dsus2   D   *Dsus2-h-D
Havin' bad times, now I am paying dues
D            Dsus4  Dsus2         D  *Dsus2-h-D
Got shoes and money, good friends too
D     Dsus4             Dsus2          D  *Dsus2-h-D
Always play to win, but always seem to lose
D            Dsus4         D   Dsus2   D
That's why I think I got a rich kid's blues

Love is just a story, a story without words

Words that always never seen and never even heard
