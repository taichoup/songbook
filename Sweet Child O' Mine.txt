[Verse]
D  
He's got a smile that it seems to me 
C9  
Reminds me of childhood memories 
     G  
Where  everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky 
D 
Now and then when I see his face 
C9 
It takes me away to that special place 
        G                                           D  
and if I   stay too long I'd probably break down and  cry 
[Chorus]
C9  G                      D   
Oh     oh, sweet child of     mine 
C9       G                     D  
Oh, oh,     oh, sweet love of     mine 
[Verse]
D  
He's got eyes of the bluest sky 
C9 
and if they thought of rain 
    G                                    D   
I'd     hate to look into those eyes and     see an ounce of pain 
D  
His hair reminds me of a warm safe place 
C9 
where as a child I'd hide 
    G                                           D   
and     pray for the thunder and for the rain to   quietly pass me by 
[Chorus]
C9  G                      D   
Oh     oh, sweet child of     mine 
C9       G                     D  
Oh, oh,     oh, sweet love of     mine 
 C9          G                     D   
Oh, oh, oh,     oh sweet child of     mine 
             C9      G               D   
Hey, hey-hey     Oh    sweet love of mine

[Verse 1]

Em
Look at your young men fighting
G
Look at your women crying
Em
Look at your young men dying
G                                 D/F#
The way they've always done before 

Em
Look at the hate we're breeding
G
Look at the fear we're feeding
Em
Look at the lives we're leading
G                               D/F#
The way we've always done before

A5  A#4  A7

                   E5
My hands are tied
     G                                  D/F#
The billions shift from side to side
           E5
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
          G                            D
For the love of God and our human rights
      Em
And all these things are swept aside
     G                                   D/F#
By bloody hands time can't deny
           E5
And are washed away by your genocide
      G                       D                   A
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

B/A  C/A  D/A

            G                      Bm
D'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
            Em
Who said     "Peace could last forever"
         G                   Bm
And in my first memories they shot Kennedy
Em                 C        D         G               Bm
I went numb when I learned to see so I never fell for Vietnam
          Em                                     G
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all that you can't trust freedom
         Bm                      Em
When it's not in your hands when everybody's fightin'
         C        D
For their promised land And


[Chorus]

G            Bm             Em
   I don't need your civil war
G                Bm                       Em   C  D
   It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
G                 Bm                        Em
   You're power hungry sellin' soldier In a      human grocery store Ain't that fresh
G            Bm             Em    C  D
   I don't need your civil war


[Solo]


[Verse]

Em
Look at the shoes you're filling
G
Look at the blood we're spilling
Em
Look at the world we're killing
G                               D/F#
The way we've always done before

Em
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
G
Look at the leaders we've followed
Em
Look at the lies we've swallowed
G                           D/F# 
And I don't want to hear no more

A5  A#4  A7

                   E5
My hands are tied
     G                                        D/F#
For all I've seen has changed my mind
                E5
But still the wars go on and the years go by
           G                   D                            Em
With no love of God or human rights 'cause all these dreams are swept aside
    G                                    D/F#
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
       E5
Who carry the cross of homicide
      G                       D                      A
And history bears the scars of our civil wars


[Chorus]

G            Bm                 Em
   I don't need your civil war
G                   Bm                               Em
   It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
G                      Bm                                Em
   You're power hungry sellin' soldier In a      human grocery store Ain't that fresh
G            Bm                 Em          C  D
   I don't need your civil war

G            Bm                 Em
   I don't need your civil war
G                   Bm                               Em
   It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
G                      Bm                                Em
   You're power hungry sellin' soldier In a      human grocery store Ain't that fresh
G            Bm                 Em          C  D
   I don't need your civil war

G            Bm                  A
   I don't need one more war
G            Bm                  A
   I don't need one more war

Whaz so civil 'bout war anyway?
