       life.   Three   children,   they    were    br  ave.
               C       C7      F
       But that    dirty   little  coward  that    shot

       his grave.

       C                   F        
It  was on  a   Saturday    night,  the moon    was shining

               C                       F           C
the agent   on  his knees,  he  de  livered up  the keys
       C   G7          C
To  the outlaws Frank   and Jesse   James.

[chorus]

   C                       F    
The people  held    their   breath  when    they    heard   of
   C       C                    
Jesse's death,  They    wondered    how he  ever    came    to
G   G7      C                       F
fail.       Robert  Ford,   it  was a   fact,   shot    Jesse
       C       C           G7       
in  the back    While   Jesse   hung    a   picture on  the
C
wall.

[chorus]

   C                   F           C    
Oh, Jesse   was a   man,    a   friend  of  the poor,   He'd
C                       G   G7      C    
never   rob a   mother  or  a   child.      He  stole   from
               F           C           C
the rich    and he  gave    to  the poor,   So  they    shot
   G7          C
Jesse   James   on  the sly.
            
[chorus]

   C                   F       C    
Well,   this    song    was made    by  Billy   Ga  shade   As
C                       G   G7          C
soon    as  the news    did ar  rive.       He  said    there
                   F           C        
was no  man with    the law in  his hand    Who could
C       G7          C
take    Jesse   James   when    a   live.
