Pink Floyd - Money (Waters)


[Verse]
Bm7
Money, get away.
Get a good job with more pay and you're okay.
Money, it's a gas.
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.


[Chorus]
F#m7
New car, caviar, four star daydream,
Em                          Bm7
Think I'll buy me a football team.


[Verse]
Bm7
Money, get back.
I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack.
Money, it's a hit.
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit.


[Chorus]
          F#m7                                 Em
I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set
                        Bm7
And I think I need a Lear jet.


[Verse]
Bm7
Money, it's a crime.
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie.
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today.


[Chorus]
F#m7                                  Em
But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that they're
            Bm
giving none away.
