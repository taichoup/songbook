"Scarlet Town"

Am
Buddy I went down to Scarlet Town
Never been there before
You slept on a feather bed
I slept on the floor

I don't mind a lean old time
Or drinking my coffee cold
But the things I seen in Scarlet Town
Did mortify my soul


Am           G    D
Look at that deep well
Am           G    D
Look at that dark grave
Am           G    D
Ringing that iron bell
G            D    Am     (not sure. C D Am works too, as well as C G Am)
In Scarlet Town today

Am G D x3
G D Am (not sure)

I spent some time in New Orleans
And came along a bend
But Scarlet Town brought me down
Low as I ever been

Look at that deep well
Look at that dark grave
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

On the day I came to Scarlet Town
You promised I'd be your bride
You left me here to rot away
Like holly on a mountainside

Look at that deep well
Look at that dark ray
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today

Now you may hide in Scarlet Town
For a hundred years or more
But the man who knows what time it is
Is knocking at the door

So fare you well, my own true love
If you never see me around
I'll be looking through a telescope
From hell to Scarlet Town

Look at that deep well
Look at that dark ray
Ringing that iron bell
In Scarlet Town today
