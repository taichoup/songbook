[Verse]
Em C D G
I want to live, I want to give
Em  C   D   G
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
Em   C D   G
It's these expressions I never give
[Chorus]
Em7 G
That keep me searching for a heart of gold
C  Am  G
And I'm getting old
Em7 G
That keep me searching for a heart of gold
C  Am  G
And I'm getting old
[Verse]
Em   C   D   G
I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
Em   C   D   G
I've crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
Em   C   D   G
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line
[Chorus]
Em7  G
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
C  Am  G
And I'm getting old
Em7  G
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
C  Am  G
And I'm getting old
[Chorus]
Em  D Em
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
Em D   Em
You keep me searching and I'm getting old
Em  D Em
Keep me searching for a heart of gold
Em  G
I've been a miner for a heart of gold
