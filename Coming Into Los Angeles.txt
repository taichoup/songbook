[Chords]
Am        Am/G      D/F#      F         E7        C




[Verse 1]
Am             Am/G        D/F#         F
Coming in from London from way over the pole
C                   E - E7
Flying in a big air-liner
Am             Am/G         D/F#      F
Chicken flying everywhere a-round the plane
C                       E - E7
Could we ever feel much finer


[Chorus]
Am          Am/G    D    Am           Am/G      D
Coming into Los Angeles, Bringin in a couple of keys
Am             Am/G       D/F#          F       C - E - E7
Don't touch my bag if you please mister customs man


[Verse 2]
There's a guy with a ticket to Mexico
No he couldn't look much stranger
Walking in the hall with his things and all
Smiling, said he was the Lone Ranger


[Chorus]
Am          Am/G    D    Am           Am/G      D
Coming into Los Angeles, Bringin in a couple of keys
Am             Am/G       D/F#          F       C - E - E7
Don't touch my bag if you please mister customs man


[Verse 3]
There's a woman walking on the moving floor
Tripping on the escalator
There's a man in the line and she's blowing his mind
Thinking that he's already made her


[Chorus]
Am          Am/G    D    Am           Am/G      D
Coming into Los Angeles, Bringin in a couple of keys
Am             Am/G       D/F#          F       C - E - E7
Don't touch my bag if you please mister customs man


[Verse 1]
Am             Am/G        D/F#         F
Coming in from London from way over the pole
C                   E - E7
Flying in a big air-liner
Am             Am/G         D/F#      F
Chicken flying everywhere a-round the plane
C                       E - E7
Could we ever feel much finer
