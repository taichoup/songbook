G C G  2x

G        Am       C     G                  Bm     C      G
Bows and flows of angel hair and ice cream castles in the air
           C            Am          C                     D
And feather canyons everywhere, I've looked at clouds that way.
   G        Am   C         G                  Bm     C    G
But now they only block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone.
       C        Am                  C                D  
So many things I would have done but clouds got in my way.

    G         Am          C          G
I've looked at clouds from both sides now,
    C      G         C         G
From up and down, and still somehow
    Bm      C       G
It's clouds illusions I recall.
 C                 D  Dsus4 D    G   
I really don't know clouds    at all.

G C G  2x

G         Am        C      G                 Bm     C       G
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels, the dizzy dancing way you feel
          C     Am                    C                   D 
When every fairy tale comes real; I've looked at love that way.
   G        Am    C      G                   Bm      C        G
But now it's just another show, you leave 'em laughing when you go
          C           Am                   C              D   
And if you care, don't let them know, don't give yourself away.
   
    G         Am        C          G
I've looked at love from both sides now,
    C        G         C         G
From give and take, and still somehow
    Bm      C       G
It's love's illusions I recall.
 C                 D Dsus4 D   G   
I really don't know love     at all.

G C G  2x

G         Am        C       G               Bm       C         G
Tears and fears and feeling proud to say "I love you" right out loud,
          C           Am                  C                   D
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds, I've looked at life that way.
   G       Am          C      G                         Bm         C
But now old friends are acting strange, they shake their heads, they say
    G
I've changed.
               C        Am                    C            D 
But something's lost but something's gained in living every day.

    G         Am        C          G
I've looked at life from both sides now,
    C       G         C         G
From win and lose, and still somehow
    Bm      C       G
It's life's illusions I recall.
 C                 D Dsus4 D   G  
I really don't know life     at all.

G C G  2x

    G         Am        C          G
I've looked at life from both sides now,
    C       G         C         G
From win and lose, and still somehow
    Bm      C       G
It's life's illusions I recall.
 C                 D Dsus4 D   G  
I really don't know life     at all.
