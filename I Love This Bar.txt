D                               A
We got winners,  We got losers,
G                                  D                       A
Chain-smokers and boozers, We got yuppies,  We got bikers,
           G                    A
We got thirsty hitch-hikers,
              Bm                                 A         G
And the girls next store dress-up like movie stars.
                             Em         Bm         G        A         D
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I love this bar.

Same chords as above

We got cowboys, We got truckers,
Broken-hearted fools and suckers, And we got hustlers, We got fighters,
Early-birds and all-nighters,
And the veterans talk about their battle scars.
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I love this bar.

Chorus

D               Bm                        D  
I love this bar,  It's my kind of place,
       E                                                        A (let ring)
Just walkin through the front door, Puts a big smile on my face,
                 Bm                             D          G
It ain't too far,   Come as your aaaarrrrrrrreeee.
                             Em         Bm         G            A            D
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I love this bar.

I've seen short skirts, We've got high-techs,
Blue-collared boys and rednecks,
And we got lovers, Lots of lookers,
I've even seen dancing girls and hookers.
And we like to drink our beer from a mason jar.
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I love this bar. (Yes I do)
      
          D             A
Toby: I like my truck.
Crowd: I like my truck.
                                   D
Toby: And I like my girlfriend.
Crowd: I like my girlfriend.
                        E                                          A (let A ring here)
Toby: I like to take her out to dinner, I like a movie now and then.

But I love this bar, It's my kind of place,
Just toein around the dance floor, Puts a big smile on my face,
No cover charge, Come as you are.
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I love this bar.
Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, Hmmm, I just love this old bar.
