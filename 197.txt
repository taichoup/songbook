G                          G             G                     D
In a neat little town they call Belfast, apprenticed to trade I was bound
    G                       Em           C             D           G
And many's the hour of sweet happiness, I spent in that neat little town
     G                  G              G                           D
Till sad misfortune came over me, which caused me to stray from the land
     G                          Em         C           D            G
Far away from me friends and relations, betrayed by the black velvet band
G                   G           G                             D
    Her eyes they shone like diamonds, I thought her the queen of the land
             G                    Em             C         D            G
    And her hair it hung over her shoulder, tied up with a black velvet band
G                      G                       G                    D         
I took a stroll with this pretty fair maid, and a gentleman passing us by
  G                    Em                 C           D             G
I knew she meant the undoing of me, by the look in her roguish black eye
 G                            G               G                       D
A gold watch she took from his pocket, and she placed it right into me hand
       G                       Em               C           D             G
And the very first thing that I thought was, bad luck to the black velvet band
G                   G           G                             D
    Her eyes they shone like diamonds, I thought her the queen of the land
             G                    Em             C         D            G
    And her hair it hung over her shoulder, tied up with a black velvet band
G                 G            G                  D
Now before a judge and a jury, next morning I had to appear
      G                Em                  C       D      G
Oh the judge he said to me "Young man, your case is proven clear 
     G                           G                G                       D
We'll give you seven years' penal servitude, to be spent far away from the land.
    G                            Em           C          D            G
Far away from your friends and relations, betrayed by the black velvet band
G                   G           G                             D
    Her eyes they shone like diamonds, I thought her the queen of the land
             G                    Em             C         D            G
    And her hair it hung over her shoulder, tied up with a black velvet band
G                       G              G               D
So come all ye jolly young fellows, and a warning take by me
   G                       Em                C          D      G
For when you are out on the town me lads, beware of them pretty colleens
           G                    G                       G                   D
For they'll feed you with strong ale "More Yeah", until you are unable to stand
        G                       Em                      C         D            G
And the very next thing that you know me lads, is you've landed in Van Diemen's Land
G                   G           G                             D
    Her eyes they shone like diamonds, I thought her the queen of the land
             G                    Em             C         D            G
    And her hair it hung over her shoulder, tied up with a black velvet band
G                   G           G                             D
    Her eyes they shone like diamonds, I thought her the queen of the land
             G                    Em             C         D            G
    And her hair it hung over her shoulder, tied up with a black velvet band
