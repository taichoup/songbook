      G                Am
With flaming locks of auburn hair
      G             Em              Am
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
      Am             C 
Your smile is like a breath of spring
      G                  Am
Your voice is soft like summer rain
      G         Em             Am
And i cannot compete with you, Jolene

There`s nothing i can do to keep
    G               Em               Am
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
   Am            C
And i can easily understand 
   G                 Am
How you could easily take my man
   G               Em                   Am
But you don`t know what he means to me, Jolene

I`m begging of you please don`t take my man
 Am      C       G       Am
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
 G                    Em             Am
Please don`t take him just because you can
[Verse]
Am              C

   G              Am

He`s the only one for me, Jolene
  Am               C
