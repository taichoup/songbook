     G#                           C#                 G#
Is it wicked not to care when they say that you're mistaken
        C#                G#                 D#
Thinking hopes and lots of dreams that aren't there? 
     G#                             C#          G#
Is it wicked not to care when you've wasted many hours 
       C#           G#            D#
Talking endlessly to anyone that's there?
A#m
I know the truth awaits me
                               D#
But still I hesitate because of fear
G#                             C#             G#              
Skipping tickets making rhymes, is that all that you believe in?
       C#               G#        D#
Wearing rags to make you pretty by design
       G#                          C#               G# 
Rusting armour for effect, it's not fun to watch the rust grow
   C#             G#               D#
For it will all be over when you're dead
A#m A#m D# x2
G#                                  C#              G#
Counting acts and clutching thoughts, by the river where the moss grows 
    C#              G#              D#
Over rocks the water running all the time
     G#                          C#                   G#
Is it wicked when you smile, even though you feel like crying
    C#                  G#          D#
Even though you could be sick at any time?
A#m
But if there was a sequel
A#m
Would you love me as an equal?
A#m                          D#
Would you love me until I'm dead?
G# C# G# C# G# D# x2 (the verse chords)
A#m
If there was a sequel 
A#m
Would you love me like an equal? 
A#m                         D#
Would you love me until I'm dead?
A#m
If there was a sequel 
A#m
Would you love me like an equal? 
A#m                         D#
Would you love me until I'm dead?
                          G#
Or is there someone else instead?
