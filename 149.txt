[Verse 1] 

(Willie Nelson)

Bm       A                     G                Bm 
I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride
A          G      D     A
Sword and pistol by my side
Em      Bm                  A              G
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Em     Bm                A                G
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
Bm            A                G        A     D
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty five
Bm         G     A
But I am still alive

[Verse 2]

(Kris Kristofferson)

Bm       A             G            Bm 
I was a sailor, I was born upon the tide
A         G     D    A
With the sea I did abide
Em            Bm               A           G
I sailed a schooner round the horn of Mexico
Em      Bm                   A               G
I went aloft and furled the main sail in a blow
Bm            A                    G       A      D
And when the yards broke off they say that I got killed
Bm        G       A
But I am living still

[Verse 3]

(Waylon Jennings)

Bm       A                     G             Bm
I was a dam builder, across a river deep and wide
A                G     D      A
Where steel and water did collide
Em              Bm             A        G
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
Em            Bm             A              G
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
Bm           A               G          A       D
They buried me in that gray tomb that knows no sound
Bm         G     A
But I am still around

[Bridge]

(All)

                D           D/C#        Bm          A           G      D/F#
I'll always be around, and around, and around, and around, and around...
Em G A D

[Verse 4]

(Johnny Cash)

Bm           A                 G          Bm 
I'll fly a starship across the universe divide
A           G        D      A
And when I reach the other side
Em           Bm                A          G
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Em         Bm           A           G
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Bm        A           G       A      D
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
Bm     G      A
But I will remain

[Outro]

(All)
                  D         D/C#        Bm         A          G     D/F#
And I'll be back again, and again, and again, and again, and again...
Em G A D
