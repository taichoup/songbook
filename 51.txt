[Verse 1]
G             Em         C        G
Come gather 'round people wherever you roam
     G            Am      C              D
And admit that the waters around you have grown
     G            Em             C               G
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
       G       Am           D
If your time to you is worth savin'
        D            D7                 Gmaj7/D     D
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone,
       G                 C    D  G
For the times, they are a chang - in'
[Verse 2]
G           Em                C              G
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
   G              Am              C           D
And keep your eyes wide the chance won't come again
   G               Em           C                G
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
           G          Am            D
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
       D     D7          Gmaj7/D  D
For the loser now will be later to win
       G                 C    D  G
For the times they are a-changin'
[Verse 3]
G         Em          C               G
Come senators, congressmen please heed the call
     G            Am             C            D
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
   G            Em           C          G
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
         G         Am            D
There's a battle outside and it's ragin'
     D               D7          Gmaj7/D     D
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
       G                 C    D  G
For the times they are a-changin'
[Verse 4]
G           Em      C              G
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
   G          Am            C          D
And don't criticize what you can't understand
    G             Em              C            G
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
    G           Am      D
Your old road is rapidly agin'
          D          D7             Gmaj7/D      D
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend a hand
       G                 C    D  G
For the times they are a-changin'
[Verse 5]
G          Em        C           G
The line it is drawn the curse it is cast
   G        Am       C        D
The slow one now will later be fast
      G       Em       C        G
As the present now will later be past
   G        Am      D
The order is rapidly fadin'
       D         D7       Gmaj7/D  D
And the first one now will later be last
       G                 C    D  G
For the times they are a-changin'
