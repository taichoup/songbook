[Verse]
G
Now, red solo cup is the best receptical
For barbecues, tailgates, fairs, and festivals
   Am
And you, sir, do not have a pair of testicals
  D                        G
If you prefer drinkin' from glass
    G
Hey, red solo cup is cheap and disposable
And in fourteen years, they are decomposable
   Am
And unlike my home, they are not foreclosable
D                      G
Freddy mac can kiss my ass
Whoo!
[Chorus]
G
Red solo cup
I fill you up
            Am
Let's have a party
            D
Let's have a party
           G
I love you, red solo cup
I lift you up
          Am
Proceed to party
          D
Proceed to party
[Verse]
G
Now, I really love how you're easy to stack
But I really hate how you're easy to crack
           Am
'Cause when beer runs down in front of my pack
     D                          G
Well, that, my friends, is quite yucky
   G
But I have to admit that the ladies get smitten
Admirin' at how sharply my first name is written
  Am
On you with a Sharpie when I get to hittin'
                        D                   G
When I get to hittin' on them to help me get lucky
[Chorus]
G
Red solo cup
I fill you up
            Am
Let's have a party
            D
Let's have a party
           G
I love you, red solo cup
I lift you up
          Am
Proceed to party
          D
Proceed to party
[Verse]
G
Now, I've seen you in blue and I've seen you in yellow
But only you, red, will do for this fellow
      Am
'Cause you are the Abbot to my Costello
   D                       G
And you are the Fruit to my Loom
G
Red solo cup, you're more than just plastic
You're more than amazing, you're more than fantastic
   Am
And believe me that I am not the least bit sarcastic
    D                 G
When I look at you and say
[Bridge]
N.C.
Red solo cup, you're not just a cup
(No! No! No! God, no! )
You're my-you're my (Friend?) friend
(Friend x3; Life-long)
Thank you for being my friend
[Chorus]
A
Red solo cup
I fill you up
            Bm
Let's have a party
            E
Let's have a party
           A
I love you, red solo cup
I lift you up
          Bm
Proceed to party
          E
Proceed to party
Repeat Chorus 2 until the end of the song.
