Teach Your Children chords
Crosby, Stills and Nash

D G D A

D                  G
You who are on the road
           D                 A      Asus4 A
Must have a code that you can live by
   D             G
And so become yourself
           D              A      Asus4 A
Because the past is just a good-bye.

D                   G
Teach your children well,
              D               A    Asus4 A
Their father's hell did slowly go by,
   D                 G
And feed them on your dreams
            D                     A     Asus4 A
The one they pick's the one you'll know by.

D                       G                               D
Don't you ever ask them why, if they told you, you will cry,
                        Bm G
So just look at them and sigh
A             D       G D A
and know they love you.

   D              G
And you, of tender years,
              D                      A     Asus4 A
Can't know the fears that your elders grew by,
      D                          G
And so please help them with your youth,
             D                 A      Asus4 A
They seek the truth before they can die.

D                  G
Teach your parents well,
                D                A    Asus4 A
Their children's hell will slowly go by,
   D                 G
And feed them on your dreams
            D                     A      Asus4 A
The one they picks's the one you'll know by.

D                       G                               D
Don't you ever ask them why, if they told you, you will cry,
                        Bm G
So just look at them and sigh
A             D       G D A
and know they love you.
