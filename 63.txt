G D Cadd9 G/B G/A  

last one do the "oh yeah, ah!" along as the song does


[Verse 1]

G
Now Ziggy played guitar,
Bm                            C
 Jamming good with Weird and Gilly,
          B    C    D
And the Spiders from Mars.
                      G
He played it left hand,
                   Em
But made it too far.
              A
Became the special man,
            C
Then we were Ziggy's band.


[Verse 2]

G
Ziggy really sang,
Bm                               C
screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo,
             B    C D
like some cat from Japan.
                         G
He could lick 'em by smiling,
                       Em
he could leave them to hang.
               A
They came on so loaded, man,
          C
well hung, snow white tan....


[Chorus]

Am    G5              F5    G5 Am
 So where were the spiders,
         G5                F5         G5 Am
While the fly tried to break our balls?
           G5           F5
Just the beer light to guide us,
    G5 D                 Dsus2
so  we bitched about his fans
D             E
and should we crush his sweet hands?


[Interlude]

G D Cadd9 G/B G/A  
G D Cadd9 G/B G/A  


[Verse 3]

G
Ziggy played for time,
Bm                        C
Jiving us that we were voodoo.
        B    C    D
The kids were just crass,
          G
He was the nazz,
              Em
With God given ass.
          A
He took it all too far,
                  C
But, boy, Could he play guitar!


[Chorus 2]

Making love to his ego,
Ziggy sucked up into his mind,
Like a leper Messiah,
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band!


[Interlude]

G D Cadd9 G/B G/A  
G D Cadd9 G/B G/A  


[Outro]

G   D Cadd9 G/B G/A    G D
Yeah...         ooo.... 
Cadd9           G
ZIGGY PLAYED GUITAR!
