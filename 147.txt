    Virgil Caine is the name, and I served on the Danville train,
Am                   C/G              F           C/E     Dm
    'Til Stoneman's Calvery came and tore up the tracks again.
Am/E                   F           C/G          Dm
    In the winter of '65, We were hungry, just barely alive.

The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and the bells were ringing,
   C/G        F               C/G           F    
The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and the people were singin'.  They went
C/G          Am              Gsus4                   F             C
La,  La, La, La, La, La,     La, La, La, La, La, La,    La, La
[Verse]
Am                   C               F           C/E       Dm
 Back with my wife in Tennessee, When one day she called to me,
Am       C                F          C/E       Dm
 "Virgil, quick, come see, there goes Robert E. Lee!"
Am/E             F                    C/G              Dm
 Now I don't mind choppin' wood, and I don't care if the money's no good.
Am/E                        F
 Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest,
        C/G                 Dm             D/F#
 But they never should have taken the very best.

[Verse]
Am               C        F      C/E      Dm
 Like my father before me, I will work the land,
Am              C         F          C/E   Dm
 Like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand.
Am/E                  F                 C                     Dm
 He was just eighteen, proud and brave,  But a Yankee laid him in his grave,
Am/E                 F
 I swear by the mud below my feet,
   C                        Dm                D/F#
 You can't raise a Caine back up when he's in defeat.

The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, and the people were singin'.  They went
C/G          Am              Gsus4                   F             C
La,  La, La, La, La, La,     La, La, La, La, La, La,    La, La
