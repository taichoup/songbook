Intro
F   Am/E    Dm7     C 
F   Am/E    C   C 
Fmaj7   Dm7 
When I look into your   eyes
   C 
I can see a love res    trained
Fmaj7   Dm7 
But darling when I  hold you
   C 
Don’t you know I feel the   same
Dm7     G 
Cause nothin’ lasts for ever
   C 
And we both know hearts can     change
Dm7     G 
And it’s hard to hold a     candle
   C 
In the cold november    rain

Fmaj7   Dm7 
We’ve been through this such a l    ong, long time
   C 
Just tryin’ to kill the     pain, oh yeah
Fmaj7 
But lovers always come and lovers always go
   Dm7     C 
And     no one’s really sure who’s lettin’ go   today, walkin’ away
Fmaj7 
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
Dm7 
I could rest my head
   C 
Just knowin’ that you were  mine, all mine

Dm7     G 
So if you want to   love me
   C 
Then darlin’ don’t  refrain
Dm7     G 
Or I’ll just end up     walkin’
   C 
In the cold november    rain

Fmaj7   G 
Do you need sometime on your    own?
   Fmaj7   G 
Do you  need sometime all   alone?
   Fmaj7   G 
Everybody   needs sometime on their     own
   Fmaj7   G 
Don’t you know you  need sometime all   alone

Em  Fmaj7   C 
I know it’s     hard to keep an     open heart
Em  Fmaj7   Dm7 
When even   friends seem out to     harm you
Em  Fmaj7   C 
But if you  could heal a    broken heart
Em  Fmaj7   G 
Wouldn’t    time be out to  charm you, whoa...

C   C 
I usually skip this part
Fmaj7   G 
Sometimes I need sometime on my     own
   Fmaj7   G 
Sometimes I     need sometime all   alone
   Fmaj7   G 
Everybody   needs sometime on their     own
   Fmaj7   G 
Don’t you know you  need sometime all   alone

Fmaj7 
And when your fears subside
Dm7     C 
And shadows still   remain, oh yeah
Fmaj7   Dm7 
I know that you can     love me
   C 
When there’s no one left to     blame
Dm7     G 
So never mind the   darkness
   C 
We still can find a     way
Dm7     G 
Cause nothin’ lasts     forever
   C 
Even cold november  rain

C   G/B     Am7     G   Fma7    G   C   Cm 
Ending on Cm is my nod to the outro that doesn’t work in a solo performance
