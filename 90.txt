Am           Dm
Talk to me softly 
       G                  C
There's something in your eyes 
Am                Dm
Don't hang your head in sorrow
G                C 
And please don't cry 
Am              Dm
I know how you feel inside 
G                       C
I've I've been there before
Am            Dm
Somethin's changin' inside you
G              C 
And Don't you know
[Chorus]
F         G    Am
Don't you cry tonight.

I still love you baby.
F         G     Am 
Don't you cry tonight. 
F         G     C
Don't you cry tonight. 
                 Am
There's a heaven above you baby. 
F             G     Am
And don't you cry tonight.
[Verse 2]
Am           Dm
Give me a whisper.
       G                  C 
And give me a sigh. 
Am                Dm
Give me a kiss 
G                C 
before you tell me goodbye.
Am              Dm
Don't you take it so hard now.
G                       C 
And please don't take it so bad. 
Am            Dm
I'll still be thinkin' of you.
G              C 
And the times we had...baby.
[Chorus]
F         G    Am
Don't you cry tonight.

F         G     Am 
Don't you cry tonight. 
F         G     C
Don't you cry tonight. 
                 Am
There's a heaven above you baby. 
F             G     Am
And don't you cry tonight.
[Verse 3]
Am           Dm
And please remember 
       G                  C 
that I never lied. 
Am                Dm
And please remember 
G                C 
how I felt inside now honey.
Am              Dm 
You gotta make it your own way.
G                       C 
But you'll be alright now sugar. 
Am            Dm
You'll feel better tomorrow. 
G              C 
Come the morning light now baby.
[Chorus]
F         G    Am
Don't you cry tonight.

F         G     Am 
Don't you cry tonight. 
F         G     C
Don't you cry tonight. 
                 Am
There's a heaven above you baby. 
F             G     Am
And don't you cry tonight.
