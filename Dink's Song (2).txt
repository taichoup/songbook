Fare The Well (Dink's Song) from Joel & Ethan Coen's film Inside Llewyn Davis
Capo on 2
[Verse 1]
C              F            C
If I had Wings, like Noah's Dove
               Am            G     F
I'd fly up the river, to the one I love
C               F  C      G         C
Fare the  well, my honey, fare thee well.
[Verse 2]
C           F      C
Well I had a man, who was long and tall
          Am            G     F
Moved his body like a cannonball
         C     F  C      G         C
Fare the well, my honey, Fare thee well
[Verse 3]
C           F      C
I remember one evening, in the pouring rain
          Am            G     F
In my heart was an aching pain
         C     F  C      G         C
Fare the well, my honey, fare thee well.
[Verse 4]
C           F      C
Muddy river is muddy and wild
          Am            G     F
Can't give a bloody for my unborn child
         C     F  C      G         C
Fare the well, my honey, fare the well.
[Verse 5]
C           F      C
Show us a bird, flying high above
          Am            G     F
Life ain't worth living without the one you love
         C     F  C      G         C
Fare the well, my honey, fare thee well.
         C     F  C      G         C
Fare the well, my honey, fare thee well
