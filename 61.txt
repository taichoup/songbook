   B                   
When I came back from Luang Prabang 
  A                            B
I didn't have a thing where my balls used to hang, 
      B
But I got a wood medal and a fine harangue. 
A                  B
Now I'm a fucking hero. 
Mourn your dead land of the free! 
If you want to be a hero follow me. 
Mourn your dead land of the free! 
If you want to be a hero follow me. 
And now the boys all envy me: 
I fought for Christian Democracy 
With nothing but air where my balls used to be. 
Now I'm a fucking hero 
Mourn your dead land of the free! 
If you want to be a hero follow me. 
Mourn your dead land of the free! 
If you want to be a hero follow me. 
When one and twenty cannon thunder 
Into the bloody wild blue yonder 
For a patriotic ball-less wonder. 
Now I'm a fucking hero. 
Mourn your dead land of the free! 
If you want to be a hero follow me. 
Mourn your dead land of the free! 
If you want to be a hero follow me. 
In Luang Prabang there is a spot 
Where the corpses of your brothers rot, 
And every corpse is a patriot, 
And every corpse is a hero. 
Mourn your dead land of the free! 
If you want to be a hero follow me. 
Mourn your dead land of the free! 
If you want to be a hero follow me.
