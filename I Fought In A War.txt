in the first part of the song you just strike the chords once
1st Verse:
Em                          A
  I fought in a war and I left my friends behind me
C                             B   
To go looking for the enemy, and it wasnt very long
Em                           A  
  Before I would stand with another boy in front of me
                                               
      C                                      B
And a corpse that just fell into me, with the bullets flying round...
1st chorus:
G                                Am
And I reminded myself of the words you said when we were getting on
C                                        B
And I bet youre making shells back home for a steady boy to wear
G                                   Am
Round his neck, well it wont hurt to think of you as if youre waiting for
C                           B
This letter to arrive because Ill be here quite a while
In the second 
down,down,up,up,down,up
2nd verse:
Em                          A
  I fought in a war and I left my friends behind me
C                             B  
To go looking for the enemy, and it wasnt very long
Em                              A       
  Before I found out that the sickness there ahead of me
C                              B         
Went beyond the bedsit infamy of the decade gone before
2nd chorus:     
G                               Am      
And I reminded myself of the words you said when we were getting on
C                                        B        
And I bet youre making shells back home for a steady man to wear
G                                  Am
Round his neck, well it wont hurt to think of you as if youre waiting for
C                            B            
This letter to arrive because Ill be here quite a while

3rd Verse:
Em                           A  
  I fought in a war, and I didnt know where it would end
C                               B
It stretched before me infinitely, I couldnt really think
Em                                  A   
  Of the day beyond now, keep your head down pal
C
Theres trouble plenty in this hour, this day
B
I can see hope I can see light
3rd Chorus
G                               Am                              
And I reminded myself of the looks you gave when we were getting on
C                                        B
And I bet youre making shells back home for a steady man to wear
G                                  Am        
Round his neck, well it wont hurt to think of you as if youre waiting for
C                            B
This letter to arrive because Ill be here quite a while
